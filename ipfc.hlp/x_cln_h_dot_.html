    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

 :hn [id=label] [res=number] [name=label] [hide].
 
The :h tags create sections for the help document. A section is one or more
lines of text that contains information about a topic. Like sections in a
book, each section in a help document has a heading. A section heading is a
word or phrase that indicates the topic. Depending on the document profile
(as specified by the :docprof tag), the section headings may also appear in
the table of contents for the help document.
 
The :h tags also define the help panels for a help document. Any section
whose heading level is within the range specified by the :docprof tag is a
help panel. The integer value n given in the :h tag specifies the section's
heading level. A help panel is special in that the complete text of the
section can be viewed as a whole, separate from any other section having the
same or higher level. Also, the section heading for a help panel appears in
the title bar of the help window instead of within the help window. For
sections that are not help panels, the section appears just as it would be
expected to for a book──that is, the section is nested within a higher-level
section, the section heading starts on a new line, and the section text
follows immediately after the heading.
 
A section must start with a :h tag. The section ends at the first :h tag
having the same or higher level.
 
<b>Parameter  Description</b>
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
<i>n</i>          Specifies the heading level. This value can be any integer in the
           range 1 to 9. Heading level 1 is the highest, 9 is the lowest.
 
<b>id    </b>     Identifies the heading label. The label value can be a
           combination of letters and digits, but it must be unique (that
           is, no other heading may have the same label). The heading label
           can be used in a heading reference to identify the heading and
           display the help panel that contains the corresponding section.
 
<b>res      </b>  Identifies the help-panel resource number. The number value can
           be any integer, but it must be unique (that is, no other heading
           may have the same number). The resource number is used in an
           application's help table and help subtables to identify the help
           panel to display for a given window or menu item. The resource
           number can also be used in a heading reference to identify the
           heading.
 
<b>name       I</b>dentifies the help panel resource name. The name value can be
           any combination of letters and digits, but it must be unique
           (that is, no other heading may have the same name). The resource
           name is used by an application to display a specific help panel.
           The resource name can also be used in a heading reference to
           identify the heading.
 
<b>hide</b>       Specifies a hidden section heading. This option removes a section
           heading from the table of contents. The option is ignored if the
           heading level is not in the range specified by the document
           profile or if the heading has subordinate headings. Hidden
           sections cannot be viewed unless a heading reference is linked to
           a hypertext word or phrase or the application uses the heading
           resource number or name to display the section.
 
<b>Comments</b>
 
Heading levels cannot be skipped. If a help document contains a section with
heading-level 3, that section must be contained in another section with
heading-level 2, and the level-2 section must be in a section with
heading-level 1.
 
The id, res, and name parameters are ignored for sections whose heading
level is not specified by the document profile. This means the corresponding
label, resource number, or resource name cannot be used to refer to the
section.
 
<b>Example</b>
 
This example uses the :h1 tag to create one help panel for the document.
Since the :docprof tag only specifies heading-level 1, the :h2 tag does not
create a separate help panel. Instead, the text is included in the Copy help
panel.
 
    :h1 id=cpy.Copy
    The :hp2.Copy:ehp2. command copies files from one directory to
    another, or from one drive to another.
    :p.
    :h2.Syntax
    \.br
    Copy :hp1.filename:ehp1. :hp1.destination:ehp1.

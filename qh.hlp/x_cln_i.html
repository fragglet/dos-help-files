    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<b>.list</b>
 
The .list command specifies that a topic is to be treated as a list. A list
topic is different from a normal topic in three ways:
 
♦  A highlighted line is displayed. When the UP ARROW and DOWN ARROW keys
   are pressed, the highlighted line moves instead of the text. In topics
   that are not lists, no highlighted line is displayed and the UP ARROW and
   DOWN ARROW keys scroll the text.
 
♦  When the ENTER key is pressed, the first word on the current highlighted
   line is searched for as a topic name. If this word is not found in any of
   the databases, the entire line, up to the first two consecutive spaces,
   is searched for as a topic name. In topics that are not lists, the ENTER
   key is ignored.
 
♦  When the left mouse button is clicked, the first word on the line the
   mouse pointer is over is searched for as a topic name. If this word is
   not found in any of the databases, the entire line, up to the first two
   consecutive spaces, is searched for as a topic name. In topics that are
   not lists, the word underneath the mouse is searched for as a topic
   name.
 
The .list command must precede any text in the topic. Normally, .list
occupies the first line after the .context command.
 
<b>Example</b>
 
The following is an example of a list topic:
 
    .context Win calls
    .list
    WinAddAtom                Adds an atom to an atom table
    WinAddSwitchEntry         Adds an entry to the switch list
    WinAlarm                  Generates an audible alarm
    WinAllocMem               Allocates memory from the heap space
 
<b>.category, .context, .freeze, .paste, .popup, .ref, .topic</b>

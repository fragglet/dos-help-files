                             QuickHelp Options
 
Options may be specified either in the QH environment variable or on the
command line. When QuickHelp starts, it first processes all options in the
QH environment, and then processes any additional options on the command
line. The following list describes the possible options:
 
<b>Option          Description</b>
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
<b>-d fil</b>ename     Specifies either a specific database name or a path where
                the data bases can be found. If you specify a filename, then
                the database in that file is loaded. If you specify a path,
                then all files with the extension .hlp are loaded. You may
                also use the wildcard characters * and ?; all files matching
                the wildcard pattern will be loaded.
 
                Instead of specifying a path, you can specify an environment
                variable by preceding it with a dollar sign and following it
                with a colon. For example, if you want to include all the
                databases in a QUICKC environment variable, you would type
                the following:
 
                          -d $QUICKC:*.hlp
 
                This command would load all databases (with the extension
                .hlp) in every directory specified by the QUICKC environment
                variable.
 
                Note: If you specify this option in the QH environment
                variable, the specified databases are loaded every time
                QuickHelp is run. You can include additional databases on
                the command line by using this option, but these databases
                will not prevent any databases specified in the QH
                environment variable from being loaded.
 
<b>-l7-</b>50          Specifies the number of lines the QuickHelp window should
                occupy. If you specify more lines than the current screen
                mode allows, QuickHelp uses the maximum number of lines
                allowed by the current screen mode. QuickHelp retains this
                value for as long as it is running, so if you later change
                the screen mode, the QuickHelp window may change. For
                example, if you specify -l30, the QuickHelp window will not
                change unless the screen mode is in 43-line or 50-line
                mode.
 
<b>-m25</b>-50         Indicates that you want to change the screen mode to display
                the specified number of lines. For example, if you want to
                display the QuickHelp window on an EGA screen in 43-line
                mode, you would type the following:
 
                          qh -m43
 
                You may use the -l and -m options together. For example, if
                you want QuickHelp to use a 43-line screen mode and a
                20-line window within that screen, you would type the
                following:
 
                          qh -l20 -m43
 
                If you request a screen mode that the current display does
                not support, the option will be ignored. If you are running
                QuickHelp as a keyboard monitor, the only screen modes
                QuickHelp can use are 25-line mode and the mode of the
                screen QuickHelp was activated in. The default mode is
                whatever was in effect when you activated QuickHelp;
                however, you could force the mode to always be 25-line mode
                by specifying -m25 in the QH environment variable or on the
                command line.
 
<b>-p fil</b>ename     Sets the name of the paste file. You must follow this option
                by a fully qualified filename. This option acts in the same
                way as the Rename Paste File command in the File menu. The
                default paste file paste.qh is placed in the directory
                specified by the TMP environment variable.
 
<b>-pa [file</b>name]  Specifies that pasting operations are to be appended to the
                current paste file (rather than overwriting the file). You
                may follow this option with the name of a file if you do not
                want paste operations to go to the default paste file
                (paste.qh in the directory specified by the TMP environment
                variable).
 
<b>-q</b>              Prevents the version message box from being displayed when
                QuickHelp is installed as a keyboard monitor.
 
<b>-rco</b>mmand       Specifies the command that QuickHelp should execute when the
                right mouse button is pressed. The default action is to
                simulate double-clicking the left mouse button. In other
                words, single-clicking the right mouse button is identical
                to double-clicking the left mouse button. The following
                commands are available to change this behavior:
 
                Command  Meaning
                ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                l        Pressing the right mouse button will display the
                         last topic viewed. This is identical to the View
                         Last command in the View menu.
 
                i        Pressing the right mouse button will display a
                         history of the last topics viewed. This is
                         identical to the View History command in the View
                         menu.
 
                w        Pressing the right mouse button will temporarily
                         hide the QuickHelp window, allowing you to select a
                         topic from the screen that was displayed prior to
                         activating QuickHelp. This is identical to the Hide
                         Window command in the View menu.
 
                b        Pressing the right mouse button will display the
                         historically previous topic. This is identical to
                         pressing the Alt+F1 key.
 
                e        Pressing the right mouse button will continue the
                         search for a topic ── displaying the next topic
                         found, if there are any additional topics with the
                         same name. This is identical to the Continue Search
                         command in the View menu.
 
                t        Pressing the right mouse button will display the
                         table of contents for the current topic. This is
                         identical to the Table of Contents command in the
                         View menu.
 
<b>-s</b>              Specifies that clicking above or below the slider causes
                QuickHelp to scroll by lines rather than by pages.
 
<b>-sg1-1</b>2         Specifies the number of full-screen sessions that QuickHelp
                should monitor. This option is valid only when you run
                QuickHelp as a keyboard monitor. The default is to monitor
                the first six sessions created.
 
<b>-t nam</b>e         Directs QuickHelp to copy the specified section of the given
                topic to the current paste file. You must follow this option
                by a section name. If the paste-file mode is Append,
                QuickHelp displays the specified topic in the window. If the
                paste-file mode is Overwrite, QuickHelp ends immediately
                after copying the section to the paste file. The following
                lists the possible topic sections:
 
                Topic    Description
                ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                all      Specifies the entire topic.
 
                syntax   Specifies the syntax section of the topic.
 
                example  Specifies the example of the topic.
 
                Note: When you specify this option, QuickHelp does not
                display its window. Instead, it searches for the topic
                specified on the command line, pastes the topic to the paste
                file, and exits. This command is normally used only by DOS
                editors that will be spawning a shell to QuickHelp and only
                want to retrieve the paste file. This option is ignored if
                QuickHelp is installed as a keyboard monitor.
 
<b>-u</b>              Specifies that QuickHelp is being run by a utility. If the
                topic specified on the command line is not found, QuickHelp
                will immediately exit with an exit code of 3.

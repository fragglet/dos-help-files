<pre><b>Window Height</b>  Use this command to change the height of the QuickHelp
window. The height is the number of lines QuickHelp occupies on the
screen. You can reduce the height so that you can click topics outside
the QuickHelp window by using a mouse. If you change the height, the new
height will be in effect as long as QuickHelp is running. To make the
new window height permanent, use the -l option in the QH environment
variable.

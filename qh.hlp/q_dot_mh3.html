    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre><b>Open Database</b>  Use this command to open other databases, up to a maximum
of 20. You can also use this command to open an ASCII file up to 64K in
length. After opening a database, you are shown a list of the databases
currently open. QuickHelp searches for topics beginning with the
database opened last. You can force QuickHelp to search a particular
database first by closing the database and then reopening it. This
technique is useful for avoiding duplicate topics in different databases
and for speeding up the search time for a topic in a frequently used
database.

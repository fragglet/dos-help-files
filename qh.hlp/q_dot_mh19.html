<b>Screen Height</b>  Use this command to change the screen height by changing
the display mode. For example, you can set the height to a value from 25
through 43 lines for an EGA display. When QuickHelp runs as a keyboard
monitor, you can choose only 25-line mode or the display mode of the
screen QuickHelp was activated in. When you change the screen mode, the
new screen mode will be in effect as long as QuickHelp is running. To
make the change permanent, use the -m option in the QH environment
variable.

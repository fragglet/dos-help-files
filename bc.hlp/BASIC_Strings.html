     You cannot perform operations on strings in the Command or Watch windows.
 
     You also cannot use LET and the assignment operator in an expression
     that changes the value of a string variable. CodeView does not support
     BASIC's dynamic strings the way they are supported in the QuickBASIC
     environments. However, you can make limited changes to a string within
     a program by using CodeView's EA (Enter ASCII) command.
 
     To do this, you must give the address of the string data as the first
     argument, and be sure that any modification you make does not change the
     length of the string. For example, if the value of MyName$ =
     "Bill Brownlee", you can use the following syntax to change it:
 
     EA SSEGADD(MyName$)  "Bill Brown   "
 
     SSEGADD returns the full address of the string variable, so it can be
     used with both near and far strings. Since the EA command bypasses the
     normal BASIC string assignment system, the trailing blanks are necessary
     to actually change the value of MyName$. MyName$ would not compare
     equally to Bill Brown, but RTRIM$(MyName$) would. Assigning a string of
     length greater than the original string length corrupts BASIC's string
     space.

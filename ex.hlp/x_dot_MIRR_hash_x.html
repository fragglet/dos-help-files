    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

' This example uses the MIRR# function to determine the modified internal
' rate of return for a series of periodic cash flows represented in an
' array of values.
 
' Note: To run this example, you must use the FINANCE.QLB Quick library.
' The FINANCE.BI include file must also be present.
 
' To try this example:
' 1. Choose New Project from the File menu
' 2. Copy the code example below to the code window
' 3. Press F5 to run the example

    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully

' This example uses the Pmt# function to determine the payment for a loan
' over a prescribed period, at a fixed annual percentage rate. It also uses
' the PPmt# function to determine what part of the payment is principal. The
' program subtracts the principal payment from the monthly payment to
' determine the interest part of the payment.
 
' Note: To run this example, you must use the FINANCE.QLB Quick library.
' The FINANCE.BI include file must also be present.
 
' To try this example:
' 1. Choose New Project from the File menu
' 2. Copy the code example below to the code window
' 3. Press F5 to run the example

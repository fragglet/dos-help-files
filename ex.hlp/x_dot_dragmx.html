' This example uses the DRAG method to drag a file name to a text box
' where the path and the name of the file are displayed. When the program
' begins you will be able to browse your file system and find the CONSTANT.BI
' file in the C:\VBDOS subdirectory using the drive, directory, and file list
' box controls. Once you've located the file, click the file name and drag it
' to the text control.
'
' To try this example:
' 1. Choose New Project from the File menu
' 2. Choose New Form from the File menu to create a form with:
'    • Drive list box
'    • Directory list box
'    • File list box
'    • Label
'    • Text box
'    Note: Use the default names for the controls in all cases. Size and
'    position all controls so they can be easily seen and used. The size and
'    position of the label is not important, since it will be changed at run
'    time.
' 3. Press Alt+F4 to return to the programming environment
' 4. Copy the code example below to the form module
' 5. Press F5 to run the example

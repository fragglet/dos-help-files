─────Rich Text Format (RTF)─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
     Rich Text Format (RTF) is a Microsoft word-processing format that
     many other word processors also support. RTF files contain special
     codes, some of which HELPMAKE recognizes.
 
     You can create RTF help text with any word processor capable of
     generating RTF output. In general, you need not worry about
     inserting RTF codes yourself. You can simply format your help
     files directly with a word processor that generates RTF using
     character attributes supported by HELPMAKE. For example, if you
     wish to make a word boldfaced, you do so with your word processor.
     The word processor then takes care of generating the proper RTF
     codes that are recognized by HELPMAKE.
 
     The only items you need to insert are the help delimiter (&gt;&gt;) and
     the context string to start each topic. You can have more than one
     context string for each topic.
 
     Each context consists of a line with the help delimiter (&gt;&gt;)
     followed by the context string. For example,
 
          &gt;&gt; strtod
 
     associates the string "strtod" with the section of text that
     follows it.
 
     HELPMAKE recognizes the subset of RTF codes listed below:
 
     RTF Code     Action
 
     \plain       Plain text
     \b           Boldfaced text
     \i           Italic text
     \v           Invisible text
     \ul          Underlined text
     \par         End of paragraph
     \pard        Default paragraph format
     \fin         Paragraph first-line indent, where &lt;n&gt; is the number
                  of spaces to indent
     \lin         Paragraph indent from left margin, where &lt;n&gt; is the
                  number of spaces to indent
     \line        New line (not new paragraph)
     \tab         Tab character
                                    -♦-

─────Setting Up Links───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
     You can establish implicit and explicit links in your help
     database.
 
     Implicit Links
 
     An implicit link is established when you label a topic with a
     context string that appears as a word or phrase elsewhere in the
     database.
 
     No explicit coding is required. Wherever the keyword appears in
     text, it functions as a link to the associated topic.
 
     Explicit Links
 
     An explicit link consists of a "hot spot" on the screen and hidden
     text which defines the behavior of the hot spot. Both the hot spot
     and the hidden text are set up using formatting flags.
     See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='x_at_L8007.html'>Formatting Flags</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
     This is done by inserting invisible text using a formatting flag;
     that is, this text is invisible when the topic text is displayed
     but is used by the help engine to link to another topic. You may
     want to surround the hot-spot text with characters that make it
     look like a "button." This technique is used in the help file you
     are reading.
 
     You can link explicitly from a topic in a help database to
 
        ■ Another topic in the same help database
 
        ■ A topic in a different help database
 
        ■ An unformatted ASCII text file

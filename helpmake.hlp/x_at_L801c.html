─────Setting Up Context Strings and Topics──────────────────────────────────
 
     A HELPMAKE source file consists of a sequence of topics separated
     by context-string definitions. One or more context-string
     definitions function as the labels for each section of topic text.
 
     When the user requests help on a keyword in the database, or
     executes one of the links, the context string determines which
     section of text will be displayed.
 
     For example, in QuickHelp format, a source file has the following
     general structure:
 
          .context a
          topic text
          ∙ ∙ ∙
          .context b
          .context c
          .context d
          topic text
          ∙ ∙ ∙
          (continuing with more topics)
 
     Each context string is defined on a single line. The topic text
     is all lines of text between sets of context lines.
 
     Note that each topic has one or more context-string definitions,
     which separate it from other topics. Each context string must be
     unique; you cannot use the same context string more than once in a
     given database.
 
     If a context string is preceded by an at sign (@), it is a "local"
     context string. Local context strings differ from regular context
     strings in the following ways:
 
        ■ You cannot implicitly link to a local context string. In
          other words, a local context does not function as a link when
          it appears as part of topic text.
 
        ■ A local context string is known only within a single help
          database. You cannot link to a local context in another help
          database.
 
        ■ Local context strings take up less space in a help database
          because they are stored as numbers rather than as a series of
          letters. For this reason, use local context strings if
          possible when defining explicit links.

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

     Syntax:  IMPORTS
                importdefinitions
 
     Defines the names and locations of functions and data items to be
     imported (usually from a DLL) for use in the application or DLL.
     An &lt;importdefinition&gt; is required for each imported function or
     data item.
 
     IMPORTS is an alternative to resolving references through an
     import library created by the IMPLIB utility. Functions and data
     items in an import library do not require an IMPORTS definition.
     See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='../misc.hlp/implib.html'>IMPLIB Summary</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span> (in Miscellaneous Utilities Help)
 
     The IMPORTS keyword marks the beginning of a section of import
     definitions. Multiple definitions must be separated by one or more
     spaces, tabs, or newline characters. IMPORTS must appear once
     before the first definition (on the same or preceding line) and
     can be repeated before each additional definition. IMPORTS
     statements can appear more than once in the file.
 
     Import-Definition Syntax
 
     [internalname=]modulename.entry
 
     &lt;internalname&gt;   The function or data-item name as it is used in
                      the importing application or DLL. The default is
                      &lt;entry&gt;. An &lt;internalname&gt; is required if &lt;entry&gt;
                      is an ordinal value.
 
     &lt;modulename&gt;     The filename of the exporting application or DLL
                      that contains the function or data item.
 
     &lt;entry&gt;          The name or ordinal value of the function or data
                      item as defined in the &lt;modulename&gt; program. A
                      decorated name is required if &lt;entry&gt; is a C++
                      function. Ordinal values are set in EXPORTS.
                      See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='EXPORTS.html'>EXPORTS Statement</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>

     Internal and External Names
 
     A given symbol (function or data item) has a name for each of
     three different contexts in two programs (applications or DLLs):
 
        ■ Within the exporting program
 
        ■ As an entry point between programs
 
        ■ Within the importing program where the symbol is used
 
     If neither program uses an internal name, the symbol has the same
     name in all three contexts. If either of the programs uses an
     internal name, the symbol may have more than one distinct name.
 
     Example
 
          IMPORTS
                       Sample.SampleRead
                       SampleA.SampleWrite
            ReadChar = Read.1
 
     This example defines three functions to be imported. The functions
     are found in the Sample, SampleA, and Read applications or DLLs.
     The function from Read is referred to as ReadChar in
     the importing application or DLL. The original name of the
     function, as it is defined in Read, may or may not be known and is
     not included in the IMPORTS statement.

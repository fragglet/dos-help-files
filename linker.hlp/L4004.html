     LINK Warning L4004
 
     possible fixup overflow at 'offset' in segment 'segment'
 
     A near call or jump was made to another segment that was not a
     member of the same group as the segment from which the call or
     jump was made.
 
     This can cause an incorrect real-mode address calculation when the
     distance between the paragraph address (frame number) of the
     segment group and the target segment is greater than 64K, even
     though the distance between the segment where the call or jump was
     actually made and the target segment is less than 64K.

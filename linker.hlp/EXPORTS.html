     Syntax:  EXPORTS
                exportdefinitions
 
     Defines the names and attributes of the functions and data made
     available to other applications and DLLs. An &lt;exportdefinition&gt; is
     required for each function or data item being exported.
 
     The EXPORTS keyword marks the beginning of a section of export
     definitions. Multiple definitions must be separated by one or more
     spaces, tabs, or newline characters. EXPORTS must appear once
     before the first definition (on the same or preceding line) and
     can be repeated before each additional definition. EXPORTS
     statements can appear more than once in the file.
 
     Some languages offer a way to export without using an EXPORTS
     statement. For example, in the C language, the __exports keyword
     makes a function available from a DLL.
 
     Export-Definition Syntax
 
     entryname [=internalname] [@ord[ nametable]] [NODATA]
 
     &lt;entryname&gt;      The function or data-item name as it is known to
                      other programs. A decorated name is required if
                      &lt;entryname&gt; is a C++ function.
                      See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='x_at_L805b.html'>Decorated Names</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
     &lt;internalname&gt;   The actual name of the exported function or data
                      item as it appears in the exporting program. The
                      default is &lt;entryname&gt;.
 
     &lt;ord&gt;            The function's ordinal position in the module-
                      definition table as an integer in the range
                      1-65,535. If &lt;ord&gt; is used, the function can be
                      called by either &lt;entryname&gt; or &lt;ord&gt;. Use of
                      ordinal positions is faster and can save space.
 
     &lt;nametable&gt;      Determines what happens to &lt;entryname&gt;. The
                      &lt;nametable&gt; can be either RESIDENTNAME or NONAME.
                      The default action with or without &lt;ord&gt; is to
                      place &lt;entryname&gt; in the nonresident names table.
                      RESIDENTNAME places &lt;entryname&gt; in the resident
                      names table. NONAME discards &lt;entryname&gt; from the
                      DLL, and the item is exported only by ordinal.
 
     NODATA           Specifies that there is no static data in the
                      function.
 
     Internal and External Names
 
     A given symbol (function or data item) has a name for each of
     three different contexts in two programs (applications or DLLs):
 
        ■ Within the exporting program
 
        ■ As an entry point between programs
 
        ■ Within the importing program where the symbol is used
 
     If neither program uses an internal name, the symbol has the same
     name in all three contexts. If either of the programs uses an
     internal name, the symbol may have more than one distinct name.
 
     Example
 
          EXPORTS
            SampleRead = read2bin @8
            StringIn   = str1     @4 RESIDENTNAME
            CharTest
 
     This example defines three exported functions. The first two
     functions can be called either by their exported names or by an
     ordinal number. In the application or DLL where they are defined,
     these functions are named read2bin and str1.

─────LINK───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
     If you specify a library in the &lt;objfiles&gt; field, it becomes a
     load library. LINK treats a load library like any other object
     file. It does not search for load libraries in directories named
     in the &lt;libraries&gt; field. You must specify the library's filename
     extension; otherwise, LINK assumes an .OBJ extension.
 
     LINK puts every module from a load library into the executable
     file, regardless of whether a module resolves an external
     reference. The effect is the same as if you had supplied all the
     library's object modules as object files in the &lt;objfiles&gt; field.
 
     Specifying a load library can create an executable file or DLL
     that is larger than it needs to be. However, loading an entire
     library can be useful when:
 
        ■ Repeatedly specifying the same group of object files.
 
        ■ Placing a library in an overlay.
 
        ■ Debugging so you can call library routines that would not be
          included in the release version of the program.

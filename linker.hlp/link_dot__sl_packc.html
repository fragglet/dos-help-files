     Syntax:  /PACKC[ODE][:number]
 
     The /PACKC option turns on code-segment packing. Code-segment
     packing is on by default for segmented executable files and for
     DOS programs created with overlays or with the /TINY option. It is
     off by default for other DOS programs. You can use /NOPACKC to
     override /PACKC. /PACKC produces slightly faster and more compact
     code. It affects only programs with multiple code segments.

     LINK packs physical code segments by grouping neighboring logical
     code segments that have the same attributes. Segments in a group
     are given the same segment address; offset addresses are adjusted
     accordingly. All items have the same physical address whether or
     not /PACKC is used. However, /PACKC changes the segment and offset
     addresses so that all items in a group share the same segment.
 
     Specify &lt;number&gt; in bytes to set the maximum size of groups formed
     by /PACKC. The default is 64K - 36 bytes. When LINK cannot add
     another segment without exceeding &lt;number&gt;, it forms a new group.

     Code-segment packing provides more opportunities for far-call
     optimization (enabled with the /FARCALL option). /PACKC and
     /FARCALL together produce faster and more compact code. However,
     this combination is not recommended for Windows applications.

     WARNING:  /PACKC can be unsafe for assembly-language programs
                   that make assumptions about the relative order of
                   code segments.

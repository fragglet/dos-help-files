     Syntax:  /P[AGESIZE]:number
 
     Specifies the page size in bytes of a new library or changes the
     page size of an existing library. The new page size &lt;number&gt; must
     be an integer power of 2 between 16 and 32,768. The default page
     size is 16 bytes for a new library and is the existing page size
     for an existing library. Combined libraries take the largest
     component page size.
 
     The page size sets the alignment of modules in the library.
     Modules start at a multiple of the page size from the beginning of
     the file. LIB builds a dictionary that holds the locations of
     names in the modules. Each location entry in the dictionary is a
     name's location from the beginning of the library file, given in
     number of pages. Because of this addressing method, a library with
     a large page size can hold more modules than a library with a
     smaller page size.
 
     The page size also determines the maximum size of the library
     file. This limit is &lt;n&gt; * 64K. For example, /PAGE:32 limits the
     file to 2 megabytes (32 * 65,536 bytes).
 
     However, for each module in the library, an average of &lt;n&gt;/2 bytes
     of space is wasted. Use a small page size unless you need to put a
     very large number of modules in a library.

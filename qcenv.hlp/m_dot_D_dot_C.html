<pre>The Calls command lists the calls that led to the current

it. The most recently executed function is listed first.
 
  ■ Choose a function from the list to display in the
    Source window, and place the cursor at its start.
 
  ■ The Locals window is updated to show the local
    variables for the function. Use the View:Windows
    command to see this window.

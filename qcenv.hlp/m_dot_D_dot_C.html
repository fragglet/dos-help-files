<pre>The Calls command lists the calls that led to the current
statement. Each call is shown with the arguments passed to
it. The most recently executed function is listed first.
 
  ■ Choose a function from the list to display in the
    Source window, and place the cursor at its start.
 
  ■ The Locals window is updated to show the local
    variables for the function. Use the View:Windows
    command to see this window.
 
TIP: After you choose a function, you can use Run:Continue
     to Cursor to execute to the start of the function.

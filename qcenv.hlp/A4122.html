    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

     Warning: A4122
     one-pass assembly may differ from two-pass
 
     A construct has been encountered when doing one-pass assembly
     (the default) that may assemble differently from how it would if
     you specified two-pass assembly. For example, the following
     statment may assemble differently during a one-pass assembly if
     name is a forward reference:
 
         IFDEF   name   ; name is defined only during pass 2.
 
     Another cause of this situation may also be a predefined equate
     (using =, EQU, or any of the text-macro directives) that cannot
     be fully evaluated on the first pass. For example, suppose that
     MyData is equated to DefinedLater and that DefinedLater is
     equated to 5 at the bottom of the program. One-pass assembly
     assumes that MyData is equal to 0; two-pass assembly associates
     MyData with the value 5.

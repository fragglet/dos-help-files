    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>The Global Flags affect all builds.
 
You can choose one of three levels of case sensitivity
for symbolic names. To link to C programs, you must
select either Preserve Case or Preserve Extrn.
 
  ■ Convert to Upper: Convert all symbols to uppercase.
 
  ■ Preserve Case:    Do not convert any symbolic names
                      to uppercase.
 
  ■ Preserve Extrn:   Convert all symbols to uppercase,
                      except for EXTRN, PUBLIC, and
                      COMM symbols. This is the default.
You can choose any of three levels of warning messages,
ranging from level 0 (no warnings) to level 2 (maximum).
QuickAssembler uses level 1 by default.
 
  ■ Level 0:  Display no warning messages.
 
  ■ Level 1:  Display serious warning messages, including
              warnings for ambiguous statements and
              questionable programming practices. This
              is the default.
 
  ■ Level 2:  Display additional warning messages, for
              statements that may produce inefficient code.
The One Pass Assembly flag increases assembly speed by
approximately 50%. QuickAssembler saves lines that it
cannot process completely on pass 1, and then goes back
and reprocesses these lines at the end of assembly.
 
The following features are incompatible with this option:
 
  ■ Listing files.
 
  ■ Alphabetical segment order (QCL /a switch).
 
  ■ Language constructs (especially conditional assembly
    blocks) that rely on two passes.
The Debug Flags control options for debug builds.
 
  ■ CodeView Info puts symbolic debugging information in
    the object file. Use this option for debugging with
    CodeView or the integrated QuickC debugger. Default.
 
  ■ Line Numbers Only puts line numbers, but no symbol
    table information, in the object file. Use this option
    to debug with SYMDEB or to trace code with QuickC.
 
  ■ Listing On generates a listing file that shows source
    code with the corresponding object code generated. The
    next screen describes options that control the listing
    type.
The following options affect the listing file generated if
Listing File is on, but have no effect otherwise:
 
  ■ Normal Listing shows macro expansion, but lists only
    macro statements that generate code or data. Default.
 
  ■ False Conditionals suppresses listing of statements
    in a conditional-assembly block that was not assembled.
 
  ■ Show Everything shows all statements generated by a
    macro and does not suppress false conditionals.
 
  ■ Pass One Information adds a pass 1 listing to the
    listing file.
You can place any options accepted by QCL in any of the
three Custom Flags text boxes.
 
Define macros and constants in the Defines text box. These
affect all builds:
 
Defines: ░░░░░░░░░░ <span class='grhilite'>◄</span>── Type names and definitions here,
                        separated by a space or a comma.
Examples:
   version=2.01  release=
   debug=on, MAX=10000, MIN=100

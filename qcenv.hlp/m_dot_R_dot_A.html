<pre>The Animate command causes QuickC to highlight each
statement as it is executed.
 
When animation is on, press any key to stop execution.
 
Use animation in conjunction with breakpoints, watch
values, and watch expressions to help you understand the
flow of control through your program.
 
TIP: Control the speed of animation with the Animate Speed
     settings of the Options:Run/Debug command.
 
NOTE: This feature was called Trace On in QuickC 1.0.

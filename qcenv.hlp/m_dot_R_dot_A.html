    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<div class="page-title"> Animate Command</div>
<pre>The Animate command causes QuickC to highlight each
statement as it is executed.
 
When animation is on, press any key to stop execution.
 
Use animation in conjunction with breakpoints, watch
values, and watch expressions to help you understand the
flow of control through your program.
 
TIP: Control the speed of animation with the Animate Speed
     settings of the Options:Run/Debug command.
 
NOTE: This feature was called Trace On in QuickC 1.0.

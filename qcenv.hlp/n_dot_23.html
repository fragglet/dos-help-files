Probably QuickC cannot set the breakpoint because the
file was compiled without CodeView information. Ensure
that CodeView Info is enabled in two places:
 
  1. Under Debug Flags in the Compiler Flags dialog box
 
  2. Under Debug Flags in the Linker Flags dialog box
 
You gain access to these dialog boxes with the &lt;Compiler
Flags&gt; and &lt;Linker Flags&gt; selections from the Options:Make
command.
 
 
                                          (PgDn for more)
 
If CodeView Info is enabled, you may have specified the
breakpoint in an incorrect format. Use the format
 
     \.file.c: line
 
replacing file with the source file name and source line
with a decimal line number.
 
The error can also occur if the requested file or line
does not exist.

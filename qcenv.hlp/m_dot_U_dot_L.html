The Learn QuickC command invokes the QuickC tutorial.
 
The tutorial does not affect any files you have already
loaded. You can continue editing them when you return to
the QuickC environment.
 
If the tutorial cannot be found on your PATH, DOS issues a
"Bad command or file name" error. Use the Customize Menu
command to change the parameters for the tutorial. You can
also use Customize Menu to remove Learn QuickC from the
menu if you never use that command.
 
Press CTRL+Q to exit the tutorial at any time and return to
the QuickC environment.

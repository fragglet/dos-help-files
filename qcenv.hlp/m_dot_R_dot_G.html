The Go command starts or continues execution. If the
program has changed since you last ran it, QuickC asks
whether to rebuild.
 
Execution proceeds from the current statement until
 
  ■ A breakpoint is reached
 
  ■ A watchpoint expression becomes true
 
  ■ The end of the program is reached
 
  ■ Execution is interrupted with CTRL+C or CTRL+BREAK

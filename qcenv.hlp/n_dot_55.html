<pre>QuickC cannot load the program because of compilation
errors.
 
You can also get this error message if you compile
or assemble with link errors and then attempt to
restart the program. If this is the case, choose
Rebuild All from the Run menu to force a program
rebuild. Then fix the errors.
 
This error may also occur when you try the Replay
command. Correct the errors, recompile, and try the
Replay command again.

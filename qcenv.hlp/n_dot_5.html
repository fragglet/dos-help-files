<pre>QuickC could not find the given file. This error may
occur if you create a new DOS shell and delete one of the
files in your program list, then return to QuickC and try
to rebuild your program.
 
Find another copy of the missing file and copy it to the
directory that contained the missing file.
 
This error also occurs if you trace into a module using
F8 and QuickC does not have access to the module's source
files. This can occur with .OBJ and .LIB files that have
CodeView information in them. Use the Debug:Calls menu
command to select the caller routine and to return out
of the module.

Shortcut key: DEL
 
Use the Clear command to delete selected (highlighted) text
from the active window without copying it to the Clipboard.
 
This leaves the contents of the Clipboard intact when
deleting text from the active window. It does not, however,
save the highlighted text to be pasted later.
 
TIP: Use the DEL key as a shortcut to delete highlighted
     text.

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>The Watchpoint command causes execution to pause at the
line on which an expression becomes true. To create a
watchpoint:
 
  ■ Type the watchpoint expression in the text box
  ■ Select &lt;Add/Delete&gt;
  ■ Start or continue execution
  ■ A dialog box appears when the expression becomes true
 
QuickC checks each watchpoint expression when you add it
and notifies you if it is illegal. If the expression
includes a local variable, ignore the message. Until you
trace into the function that defines the variable, QuickC
assumes it is undefined.
<b>Watchpoint Expressions</b>
 
A watchpoint expression consists of base-type variables
(integer, real, pointer) and constants combined with
  ■  Arithmetic operators (+ - * / %)
  ■  Relational operators ( == != &gt; &gt;= &lt; &lt;= )
  ■  Bitwise and logical operators (&amp; | ^ &amp;&amp; || &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;)
  ■  Parentheses
  ■  The structure-member (.), structure-pointer(-&gt;),
     indirection (*), or address-of (&amp;) operators
  ■  The BY, WO, and DW operators, which return the
     byte, word, or doubleword at a given address.
 
Constants are treated as decimal numbers unless they begin
with a leading '0' (octal) or 'x' (hexadecimal).
EXAMPLES:
 
i==100
i==100 || j&gt;10
work.rate * hours &gt;= 1000
 
Once you have created a watchpoint, it remains in effect
until you delete it. To delete a single watchpoint:
 
  1. Select the watchpoint expression to delete from the
     list of current expressions
 
  2. Select &lt;Add/Delete&gt;
 
To delete all watchpoints, select &lt;Clear All&gt;.

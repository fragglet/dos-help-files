<pre>You tried to compile your program with the CodeView Info
debugging option, but QuickC did not have enough memory to
include the debugging information.
 
If you still want to compile with the CodeView Info
option, remove any memory-resident programs to free up
memory and try recompiling your program.
 
Otherwise, try compiling with the Line Numbers Only debug
option, or compile with the Release option instead of the
Debug option.
 
This error can also occur if you use CVPACK on the .EXE
file and then try to debug the program using QuickC.

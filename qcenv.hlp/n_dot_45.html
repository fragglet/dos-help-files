The saved debug history file does not match the current
source file. Reasons for this error may include the following:
 
  ■ Changes to the source file
  ■ Use of the wrong history file
 
Choose &lt;Continue&gt; to ignore the error and replay the
debugging session anyway. QuickC tries to resynchronize the
debug history and the source code, but additional errors
may occur.

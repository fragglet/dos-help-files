<pre>The memory model sets limits for code and data size.
 
  ■ Tiny:    Data and code are all in one segment. Choose
             the tiny model when you make .COM files.
 
  ■ Small:   All function calls are near (code all in one
             segment), and all data pointers are near (data
             all in one segment). Default.
 
  ■ Medium:  All functions calls are far (code in multiple
             segments), and all data pointers are near
             (data in one segment).
  ■ Compact: All function calls are near (code in one
             segment), and all data pointers are far
             (data in multiple segments).
 
  ■ Large:   All function calls are far (code in multiple
             segments), and all data pointers are far
             (data in multiple segments). Each data item
             must be in a single segment.
 
  ■ Huge:    All function calls and all data pointers are
             far. The restrictions on the size of
             individual data items for arrays are relaxed.
If you intend to port your C program to another computer or
compiler, you may want special treatment of nonstandard
language features.
 
  ■ Choose ANSI Compatibility to flag all code that does
    not conform to the ANSI standard for C.
 
  ■ Choose MS Extensions to use Microsoft language
    extensions without warnings.
 
Microsoft extensions include additional keywords, such as
cdecl, fortran, and near; single-line comments; and mixed
character and string constants in initializers.
You can choose any of four levels of warning messages,
ranging from level 0 (no warnings) to level 4 (maximum).
QuickC uses level 1 by default.
 
The Debug Flags control options for debug builds.
 
  ■ Full CodeView puts symbolic debugging information in
    the object file. Use this option if you are debugging
    with CodeView or the integrated QuickC debugger.
 
  ■ Pointer Check generates run-time code that checks for
    null or out-of-range pointers. This may slow execution,
    but can prevent serious errors.
 
  ■ Incremental Compile compiles only changed routines.
The Release Flags control options for release builds.
 
  ■ Optimizations On increases execution speed, possibly
    at the expense of code size.
 
  ■ Full Optimizations optimizes loops as well.
 
  ■ Stack Checking calls a stack probe routine upon entry
    to each function. The stack probe checks that the
    stack has enough space for the function's local
    variables. Use Stack Checking while debugging to
    catch stack-overflow errors. Disable it in release
    versions for smaller, faster code.
 
Define macros and constants in the text box:
 
Defines: ░░░░░░░░░░ <span class='grhilite'>◄</span>── Type names and definitions here,
                        separated by a space or a comma.
Examples:
   version=2.01   release=
   debug=on, MAX=10000, MIN=100
 
You can use macros and constants within your C program.
Macro names are case-sensitive.
 
Use the Custom Flags section for any other command-line
options needed.

Use the Function command to find the entry point of a
function or label.
 
Before using this command, you must compile or
assemble the current source file with the Debug
option enabled.
 
The Function command is grayed until you actually start
debugging. QuickC does not have the information it needs
to find a function declaration or label until execution
has begun.

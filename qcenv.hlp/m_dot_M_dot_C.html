The Compile File command creates an object (.OBJ) file
from your current source file, but does not link the .OBJ
file into an executable (.EXE) file.
 
  ■ Use Compile File with single-module programs or with
    an individual module of a multimodule program.
 
  ■ Use Build Program to compile all the changed modules of
    a multimodule program.
 
  ■ Use the Go command on the Run menu to execute the
    program after it is built.

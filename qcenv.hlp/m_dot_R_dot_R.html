The Restart command resets execution to the first line of
the program. It reloads the program into memory and
discards the current values of all variables.
 
  ■ You may use Restart any time execution has stopped: at
    a breakpoint or watchpoint, while single-stepping, or
    when normal execution is complete.
 
  ■ Restart does not actually start execution. Use Go,
    Trace Into, Step Over, or Continue to Cursor instead.
 
  ■ Breakpoints, watchpoints, and watch expressions still
    apply after a Restart.
If you use debug history, note the following:
 
  ■  Restart does not affect the recorded debug session.
 
  ■  Similarly, Restart does not move the current history
     point.
 
  ■  After using Restart, you can use Replay to rerun a
     recorded session.
 
  ■  If you issue a command that changes the flow of
     control (for example, setting a new breakpoint),
     QuickC writes over the existing history file and
     creates a new one.

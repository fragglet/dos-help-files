<div class="page-title"> Windows Command - The Error Window (10 of 10)</div>
<pre>Use the Windows command to open, close, or switch between
shared windows. (The Source window cannot be closed.)
 
The pairs of windows below share the same screen space:
  ■ Help and Debug
  ■ Locals and Registers
  ■ Notepad and Output
 
A bookmark marks your place in a window. To set one, press
CTRL+K+n, where n is from 0-3 (e.g. CTRL+K+1). To find a
previously set bookmark, open the window &amp; press CTRL+Q+n.
 
TIP: F6 moves to the next open window. CTRL+F4 closes the
     current window. CTRL+F8 resizes the current window.
The title bar contains icons that give you access to
several useful functions.
 
┌─┤•├─┤↔├─────── LOCALS ──────┤↑├─┐
   ▲   ▲           ▲           ▲
   │   │           │           │
   │   │           │           └─ Maximize box -- increases
   │   │           └─Title        or reduces window size
   │   │
   │   └─ Switcher -- displays the shared window
   │
   └─ Close box -- closes the window
 
TIP: CTRL+F6, like the switcher, switches from one of a
     pair of shared windows to the other.
The Debug window displays watch expressions. Regular
editing commands can be used in the Debug window.
 
  ■ Add a watch expression to the Debug window by using the
    Debug:Watch Value or Debug:Watchpoint command.
 
  ■ Disable a watch expression by commenting out the line
    (inserting // as the first two characters).
 
The Debug window is shared with the Help window. Select the
switcher (<span class='grhilite'>◄</span>-<span class='grhilite'>►</span>) or press CTRL+F6 to swap if both are open.
The Help window displays help on the C language and
run-time library. All the usual read-only editor commands
(PGUP, PGDN, Search, Copy, etc.), plus F1 and the Right
mouse button, work in this window.
 
  ■ Use TAB to move forward or SHIFT+TAB to move backward
    through the hyperlinks.
 
  ■ Use a lowercase letter to move to the next hyperlink
    starting with that letter. An uppercase letter moves
    to the previous hyperlink starting with that letter.
    (This is especially useful in the index.)
 
The Help window is shared with the Debug window. Select the
switcher (<span class='grhilite'>◄</span>-<span class='grhilite'>►</span>) or press CTRL+F6 to swap if both are open.
The Locals window displays watch expressions for all local
variables in the currently active function. The Locals
window is updated every time the program enters a function.
 
Unlike the Debug window, the Locals window
 
  ■ Clears all local watch variables upon exit from the
    function
 
  ■ Adds all local variables as watch expressions upon
    entry to the function
 
The Locals window is shared with the Registers window.
Use the switcher (<span class='grhilite'>◄</span>-<span class='grhilite'>►</span>) or CTRL+F6 to swap if both are open.
The Registers window displays the contents of the computer
registers.
 
The Registers window is shared with the Locals window.
Select the switcher (<span class='grhilite'>◄</span>-<span class='grhilite'>►</span>) or press CTRL+F6 to swap if both
are open.
The Source window is the primary edit window. It contains
your program's source file or header files.
 
In the Source window you can
 
  ■ Use SHIFT+F3 after compiling a program to move to
    the next error
 
  ■ Use SHIFT+F4 to move to the previous error
 
  ■ Use the *.KEY macro files to configure the QuickC
    editor like another editor
 
The Source window cannot be closed.
The Notepad window is a secondary edit window. It supports
the same editing commands as the Source window, but not
compiling or building programs.
 
Use the Notepad window to store temporary information like
  ■ Register values, copied from the Registers window
  ■ Watch values, copied from the Debug window
  ■ Examples or online help you frequently use
 
The same file cannot be loaded into both the Source and
Notepad windows. Closing the Notepad window does not unload
the current file; use File:New for that purpose.
 
The Notepad window is shared with the Output window. Use
switcher (<span class='grhilite'>◄</span>-<span class='grhilite'>►</span>) or CTRL+F6 to swap if both are open.
The Output window is a copy of the program's output screen.
It is read-only, but you may copy from it to the Clipboard.
Use the Output window to
 
  ■ View program output and other windows simultaneously.
 
  ■ View character-mode output. It cannot be used for
    graphics output.
 
The Output window is shared with the Notepad window.
Select the switcher (<span class='grhilite'>◄</span>-<span class='grhilite'>►</span>) or press CTRL+F6 to swap if
both are open.
 
TIP: Use F4 to switch between the normal output screen and
     the QuickC environment.
The Error window is a read-only window that opens
automatically to display compiler or linker errors. All
the usual read-only editor commands work in this window.
 
To find the source line that caused a compiler error:
 
  ■ Select the error message with the arrow keys or mouse.
    The line that caused the error is highlighted.
  ■ Use SHIFT+F3 to move to the next error.
  ■ Use SHIFT+F4 to move to the previous error.
 
TIP: For help on any error message in the window, put the
     cursor on the message and press F1 or the Right mouse
     button.

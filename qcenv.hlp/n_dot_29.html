<pre>QuickC could not find the .KEY file that you gave on the
QC command line, or that .KEY file was in an incorrect
format.
 
Make sure you are specifying an existing .KEY file. If
so, copy a new version of the .KEY file from the QuickC
distribution disks, then restart QuickC and specify the
.KEY file again.

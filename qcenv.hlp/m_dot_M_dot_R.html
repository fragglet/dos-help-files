The Rebuild All command compiles and links all the files in
a multimodule program, creating a single executable file.
Rebuild All recompiles and relinks every file, even those
that have not changed.
 
Multimodule programs require a program list that contains
the names of all the files needed by the program. If you
have not set a program list, QuickC assumes that the
current file is the only module in the program.
 
To manage program lists, use the Set Program List, Edit
Program List, and Clear Program List commands.
 
Use Run:Go to run the program after it is built.

<pre>The QuickC environment detected a lock (QC.LCK) file,
which indicates that another instance of QuickC is running
on the system. You can receive this message if working in
a multitasking environment, or if you execute a DOS Shell
and then attempt to execute QC from the shell.
 
Choosing &lt;Yes&gt; exits from this instance of QuickC. Choosing
&lt;No&gt; causes the new instance of QC to run.

<pre>Use the Print command for a hard copy of an entire file
or of selected text from any window.
 
  <span class='grhilite'>►</span> The Print command sends the text to the printer
    connected to the DOS port named LPT1. Make sure a
    printer is attached to this port, is powered on, and
    is on line.

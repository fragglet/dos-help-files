<pre>For each custom menu item, you must supply the following:
 
  ■ Menu Text: the text that will appear on the menu. An
    ampersand (&amp;) defines the following letter as a short-
    cut key. The first letter is a shortcut, by default.
    Use ALT+U+letter to invoke an item by its shortcut key.
 
  ■ Path Name: the full path for the program.
 
  ■ Arguments: the arguments you would give on the DOS
    command line to run the program.
 
  ■ Initial Directory: QuickC treats this as the current
    directory when the program runs, but does not actually
    change the current directory for QuickC.
 
  ■ Select the Prompt before Returning option to see the
    output screen. You will be prompted to press a key
    before returning to QuickC.
 
  ■ Define an accelerator key for a frequently used utility
    to invoke the program without using the menu. You can
    choose any function key; QuickC notifies you if the key
    is already defined. The name of the key appears beside
    the item on the menu.
Custom menus support the following predefined macros:
 
  $FILE1  Name of file in Source window
  $FILE2  Name of file in Notepad window
  $FILE   Name of file in current window
  $PROJ   Base name of program list (.MAK) file; if no
          program list, base name of current source file
 
  $LINE1, $COL1  Current line or column in Source window
  $LINE2, $COL2  Current line or column in Notepad window
  $LINE,  $COL   Current line or column in current window
 
Macro names are case sensitive.

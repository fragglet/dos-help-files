<div class="page-title"> Display Command (4 of 4)</div>
<pre>The Language selection governs file-extension defaults and
the effect of the Help menu's Contents and Index commands.
 
  ■ C sets all File menu defaults to *.c Help Contents and
    Index to show C topics. The View menu's Include command
    responds to files with a .H extension.
 
  ■ Assembler sets all File menu defaults to *.asm Help
    Contents and Index to show Assembly topics. The Include
    command responds to files with a .INC extension.
 
  ■ Auto uses C or Assembler defaults, depending on the
    extension of last file loaded into Current Window. If
    the extension is not .ASM, C defaults are assumed.
 
Tab Stops: [  ]  ■ Sets the number of spaces for tab stop;
                   default is 8.
 
[ ] Keep Tabs    ■ If on, tab characters are preserved;
                   if off, tabs are converted to spaces.
 
[ ] Scroll Bars  ■ Turn off the scroll bars to gain more
                   space for text.
 
[ ] Show 8087    ■ Select Show 8087 to see 8087 registers
                   displayed in Registers Window. You must
                   have coprocessor or emulator routines.
 
  ■ Right Mouse Button:
    By default, this button brings up help on the word or
    phrase under the cursor. SHIFT+Right mouse button
    compiles the file and runs it as far as the cursor.
 
    Select Continue to Cursor to swap these actions.
 
  ■ Smart Help causes the Advisor to be insensitive to
    the presence or absence of leading underscores. Thus,
    _printf and printf bring up the same topic.
 
  ■ Search Multiple Help Topics causes QuickC to search
    the current help file when you use the Search menu.
    Otherwise, only the current help topic is searched.
 
  ■ Save before Build causes QuickC to save a modified
    source file before building the program. This procedure
    keeps files in sync and prevents loss of data in case
    the program crashes the system.
 
  ■ Prompt before Saving Files causes the environment to
    prompt you before executing the save described above.

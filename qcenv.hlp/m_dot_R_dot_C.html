<pre>Shortcut key: SHIFT+Right mouse button
 
The Continue to Cursor command executes your program as far
as the line that currently has the cursor.
 
  1. Place the cursor on the line where you want execution
     to stop
 
  2. Press F7
 
Execution pauses at the start of the line with the cursor.
 
TIP: If you use this command often, use the Options:Display
     command to assign it to the Right mouse button. The
     help key will change to SHIFT+Right mouse button.

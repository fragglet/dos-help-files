Use the DOS Shell command to leave QuickC temporarily so
that you can use DOS commands for such tasks as deleting,
copying, and renaming files.
 
To use DOS and return to QuickC:
  1. Choose the DOS Shell command from the File menu.
 
  2. Perform any DOS tasks, except for starting TSR
     programs, such as MSHERC.COM. Also, don't delete any
     files you worked on during this session or any QuickC
     program files.
 
  3. Type Exit at the DOS prompt to return to QuickC.

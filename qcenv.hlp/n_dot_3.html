<pre>The file you tried to load in the current window was
already loaded in another window. For example, this
message appears if you open SOURCE.C in the Program
window and then try to open SOURCE.C in the Notepad
window.
 
If you want to load a file that is already loaded in a
different window, press F6 to move to that window and do
one of the following:
 
  ■ Open the File menu and choose the Save As command
    to save the file under a different name.
 
  ■ Open the File menu and choose the New command to
    clear the file.

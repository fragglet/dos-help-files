<pre>Shortcut key: F4
 
Use the Output Screen command, or press F4, to toggle
between the QuickC environment screen and the program
output screen.
 
This command lets you quickly refer to your program's
output as you edit or debug.
 
If you don't need the whole screen for your source code,
use the View:Windows command to open the Output window.
That way, you can view code and output simultaneously.

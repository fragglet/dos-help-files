Use the Repeat Last Find command to repeat a search without
retyping the text to be found.
 
Repeat Last Find uses the same search string as the most
recently executed Find or Change command.
 
TIP: If no Find or Change command has been executed since
     you started QuickC, Repeat Last Find searches for the
     word at the cursor position.
       ■ If the cursor is on a word, it becomes the
         target of the search.
       ■ Otherwise, the word nearest the left of the
         cursor becomes the target.

<pre>Use the Read Only command to make the current file read-
only. Once a file is made read-only, editing commands like
Cut, Paste, and Clear are not permitted. Use of this
command does not affect the attribute setting of the file
at the DOS level.
 
Whenever the active window is read-only, an "R" appears in
the status bar and a bullet precedes the Read Only command:
 
     ┌─────────────────────┐
     │• Read Only          │
     └─────────────────────┘
 
TIP: The Help window is always read-only.

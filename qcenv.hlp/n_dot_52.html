    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>QuickC cannot read the named debug history file for any of
the following reasons:
 
  ■  The file cannot be found
  ■  The file cannot be opened, possibly because of an
     earlier crash
  ■  The file is not in the correct format, possibly
     because it was not created as a history file

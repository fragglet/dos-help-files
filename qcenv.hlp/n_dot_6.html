<pre>The QuickC editor can use only text files. You tried to
load a file in an improper format:
 
  ■ binary file (.EXE, .COM, or .LIB files).
 
  ■ zero length file.
 
  ■ file with an extra carriage return at the end. Exit
    QuickC and use the CRLF utility to fix this file.
  ■ Pre-existing version of a .LST file or a corrupted
   .LST file. Generate a new listing file with QuickAssembler;
    the new file is guaranteed to have the correct format.

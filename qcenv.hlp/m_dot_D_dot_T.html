<pre>
Use Truncate User Input to clear all or part of the user
input in "program.INP" and supply new input instead.
 
This command is available only when History is on.
 
The new input must be compatible with the recorded debugger
commands, if you are replaying a history. If the input is
incompatible, a dialog box appears, informing you of a
history synchronization error.
 
To clear all the recorded user input:
 
  1. Select Run:Restart or press SHIFT+F5.
  2. Select Truncate User Input.
To clear the recorded user input beyond a certain point:
 
  1. Use SHIFT+F10 or SHIFT+F8 to browse forward or
     backward to the point where new input will start.
 
  2. Select Replay to rerun the session to that point.
 
  3. Select Truncate User Input. QuickC retains the input
     it has already used, but discards any additional input
     in the history file.
 
  4. Your program will prompt for input at the appropriate
     times. QuickC records this input.

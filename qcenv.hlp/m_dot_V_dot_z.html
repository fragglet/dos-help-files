Shortcut key: CTRL+F10
 
Use the Maximize command to toggle windows from normal to
maximum size. Maximize changes all windows, not just the
active window.
 
If you have a mouse, you can also use the box in the upper
right corner of the window to toggle its size.
 
TIP:  Use F6 to move from one window to another.
      Use CTRL+F10 to switch windows from regular size
      to maximum size, and back again.

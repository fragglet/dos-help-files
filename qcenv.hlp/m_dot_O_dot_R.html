<pre>Use the Run/Debug command to specify a command line for the
program and to control screen activity during execution.
 
Command Line: ░░░░░░░░░░ <span class='grhilite'>◄</span>── Command to invoke the program
QuickC writes this line in the .MAK program list.
 
Animate Speed sets the speed at which QuickC traces and
swaps the screen. Animation must be on (use Run:Animate).
 
The Screen Swap options control when QuickC swaps from the
Source window to the output screen as your program runs.
  ■ Auto: swaps screens for both input and output
  ■ On:   swaps on every executable statement; used with
          programs calling mouse or BIOS video services
  ■ Off:  swaps only for output
The Debug History options determine what portion of your
debug session is saved in a disk file.
 
  ■ Record All saves debugger commands and program input.
  ■ Record Debug Commands saves only debugger commands.
  ■ Record User Input saves only program input.
 
Debug commands are saved in project.HIS and user input in
program.INP. For "program" QuickC uses the base name of
the program list, or the base name of the current source
file if there is no program list. For example, the files
would be BOO.HIS and BOO.INP for the program list BOO.MAK.
 
Select Debug:History On to record. You can save up to 1300
characters of user input and any amount of debug commands.

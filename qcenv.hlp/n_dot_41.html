<pre>You selected Replay, but the current version of the program
was built without debugger information. To build your
program with debugger information, do the following:
 
  1. Ensure that CodeView Info is enabled in two places:
 
       ■ Under Debug Flags in the Compiler Flags dialog box
       ■ Under Debug Flags in the Linker Flags dialog box
 
     You gain access to these dialog boxes through the
     &lt;Compiler Flags&gt; and &lt;Linker Flags&gt; selections from
     the Options:Make command.
 
  2. Rebuild the program with the Make:Build Program or
     Make:Rebuild All command.

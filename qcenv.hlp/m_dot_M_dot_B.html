<pre>The Build Program command compiles and links all out-of-
date files used in a multimodule program and creates a
single executable file. A file is out-of-date if it has
been edited since it was last compiled, or compiled since
it was last linked.
 
Multimodule programs require a program list that contains
the names of all the files needed by the program. If you
have not set a program list, QuickC assumes that the
current file is the only module in the program.
 
To manage program lists, use the Set Program List, Edit
Program List, and Clear Program List commands.
 
Use Run:Go to run the program after it is built.

The Full Menus command toggles between full and short
menus.
 
  ■ Short menus provide a simplified environment suitable
    for quickly learning important commands. Use short
    menus to get started with QuickC and to develop
    single-module programs.
 
  ■ Full menus provide access to all features, including
    advanced debugging and program list options.

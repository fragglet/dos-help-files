<pre>Shortcut key: ALT+BACKSPACE
 
The Undo command retracts your most recent edit. It
restores the current line to its previous condition.
 
 <span class='grhilite'>â–º</span> The Undo command works only while the cursor is still
   on the edited line. Once you move the cursor off that
   line, Undo no longer has effect.

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>When History is on, you can use the Undo command to rescind
the last debugger command. Undo can traverse back through
the debug session one command at a time, until it reaches
the beginning.
 
Undo has the same effect as pressing SHIFT+F8 and then
selecting Replay.
 
Undo has no effect when History is off or when you are not
recording debugger commands.

<pre>When History is on, you can use the Undo command to rescind
the last debugger command. Undo can traverse back through
the debug session one command at a time, until it reaches
the beginning.
 
Undo has the same effect as pressing SHIFT+F8 and then
selecting Replay.
 
Undo has no effect when History is off or when you are not
recording debugger commands.

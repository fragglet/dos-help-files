<pre>Use the Linker Flags command to set linker options. The
Global Flags section applies to both Debug and Release
builds.
 
  ■ Use Ignore Case to toggle case sensitivity.
 
  ■ Disable the extended dictionary if you redefine a
    library symbol. The linker will not search its internal
    dictionary for symbol definitions.
 
  ■ Select the appropriate Generate .COM File option
    to build a stand-alone program in tiny memory model.
    Select C to include the C start-up code, select Asm
    otherwise.
  ■ Set the stack size if the 2K default is inadequate.
    The number entered here overrides the size given
    by the stack segment in your program.
 
  ■ Set the Memory Needs parameter if you want to limit
    the amount of memory DOS allocates to the program.
    By default, DOS allocates all available memory. The
    number entered here gives maximum paragraphs of
    memory desired. (A paragraph is 16 bytes.)
The Debug Flags section applies to Debug builds only.
 
  ■ CodeView Info puts symbol table information in the
    .EXE file. This option and the CodeView Info option
    under Debug Flags are both required if you use CodeView
    or the QuickC debugger.
 
  ■ Choose Map File if you want a symbol listing. The
    map file is given the same name as the program and the
    extension .MAP. You can use the File:Open command to
    load and view the Map file.
 
  ■ Incremental Link links changed object modules only. Do
    not use this option if you plan to debug with CodeView.

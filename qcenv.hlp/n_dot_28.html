QuickC found a QC.INI file that was created by an
earlier version of QuickC. Because the QC.INI file is
incompatible, QuickC ignores the options in the file
and uses its defaults. The next time you change settings
with the Option menu's commands, QuickC will save a new
QC.INI file with those settings.

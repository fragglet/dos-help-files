You can edit C program files with any editor; you are not
required to use the QuickC editor.
 
To define a custom editor, use the Customize Menu command:
  1. Select Customize Menu
  2. Tab to Custom Editor in the list and select &lt;Edit&gt;
  3. Supply the information pertaining to your editor
 
To invoke the custom editor:
  ■ Select Custom Editor from the menu
    OR
  ■ Press ALT+U+E
    OR
  ■ Use the accelerator key if you have defined one
 
NOTE: Do not use a custom editor when you are debugging,
      if you need the Debug menu's History feature to
      record the session.
 
      The history file identifies debug events by source-
      line number. The QuickC editor can update the line
      numbers if the source code changes, but custom
      editors cannot. As a result, a custom editor may
      cause synchronization errors when you replay the
      record.

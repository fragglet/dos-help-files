You typed CTRL+C to stop executing a program that
installed a CTRL-C handler. The following types of
programs may install CTRL-C handlers:
 
  ■ Programs that use floating-point arithmetic
  ■ Programs that make signal( SIG_INT... ) calls
  ■ External libraries
 
Choose &lt;Yes&gt; to restart the program. If you choose &lt;No&gt;
and continue execution, your program might cause the
system to crash.
 
To avoid this problem, use CTRL+BREAK instead of CTRL+C to
terminate programs within the QuickC environment.

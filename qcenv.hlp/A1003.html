     Error: A1003
     Out of memory
 
     All available memory has been used, either because the source
     file is too long, or because there are too many symbols defined
     in the symbol table.
 
     You can solve this problem in several ways. First, try assembling
     with no listing or cross-reference file. If this works, you can
     reassemble by specifying a null object file to get a listing or
     cross-reference file. You can also rewrite the source file to
     require less symbol space.
 
     Techniques for reducing symbol space include minimizing use of
     macros, equates, and structures; using short symbol names; using
     tab characters in macros rather than series of spaces; using
     macro comments (;;) rather than normal comments (;); and purging
     macro definitions after their last use.

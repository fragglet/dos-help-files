Use the Open Last File command to load the file you most
recently edited. A dialog box appears if a program is
already loaded into memory.
 
  ■ Choose &lt;Yes&gt; to save the program to disk.
  ■ Choose &lt;No&gt; to clear the program without saving it.
  ■ Choose &lt;Cancel&gt; or press ESC to look at the program in
    memory before making a decision.
 
TIP: Use this command to move between two source files or
     between a source and an include file. After you save
     one file and load another, use Open Last File (or F2)
     to switch back and forth.

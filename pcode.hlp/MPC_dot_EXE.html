  MPC [/Fe outputfile] [inputfile]
 
  Controlling the P-Code Build Process
 
  When you compile a program into machine code from the command line, CL
  performs the compilation and then calls LINK to do the linking. When you
  use the /Oq option to compile a program into p-code, CL calls one other
  program in addition to LINK: the Make P-Code utility (MPC).
 
  CL calls the MPC utility after calling LINK. MPC reads the executable
  (.EXE) file produced by LINK and generates several internal tables
  needed by the run-time interpreter. Once MPC has added these tables, the
  executable file is ready to run.
 
  MPC requires a segmented executable file as input, even if DOS is the
  target. P-code object modules contain special-purpose records that force
  the generation of a segmented executable.
 
  If you want to separate the compilation phase from the link and
  post-link phases, specify the /c option in addition to the /Oq option.
  This option tells CL to stop after the compilation step. You can run
  LINK and MPC in one step by specifying the /PCODE option for LINK. For
  example, the command
 
  LINK /PCODE MYPROG.OBJ
 
  links MYPROG.OBJ and runs MPC on the resulting executable MYPROG.EXE.
 
  You can also invoke invoke MPC individually. If you don't specify the
  /PCODE option, LINK performs only the standard linking procedure and
  does not call any additional programs. However, if the .OBJ file
  contains p-code, LINK cannot produce a file that can be executed. MPC is
  required to make a p-code program executable.
 
  Use the MPC program to convert the LINK output into an .EXE file that
  you can run. Specify a name for MPC's output file using the /Fe option.
  For example:
 
  MPC /Fe MYPROG.EXE MYPROG.PXE
 
  This command reads MYPROG.PXE (linker output) and produces a file named
  MYPROG.EXE. If you don't specify the /Fe option, MPC uses the name of
  the input file.

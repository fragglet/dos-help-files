<b>REM $metacommand [$metacommand] [:argument]</b>
    or
<b>' $metacommand [$metacommand] [:argument]</b>
 
    ■ REM or ' enclose a metacommand in a program comment.
    ■ $metacommand is the name of one of the three BASIC metacommands
      ($STATIC, $DYNAMIC, and $INCLUDE).
    ■ $INCLUDE is the only metacommand that takes an argument
      (see <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='$INCLUDE.html'>$INCLUDE</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span> for details).
 
Usage Notes
    ■ Metacommands begin with a dollar sign ($) and are always enclosed
      in a program comment. More than one metacommand can be given in one
      comment. Multiple metacommands are separated by white-space
      characters: space, tab, or line feed. Metacommands that take
      arguments have a colon between the metacommand and the argument:
 
        REM $METACOMMAND [:argument]
 
    ■ String arguments must be enclosed in single quotation marks. White-
      space characters between elements of a metacommand are ignored. The
      following are both valid forms for metacommands:
 
        REM $STATIC $INCLUDE:  'datadefs.bi'
        REM   $STATIC    $INCLUDE :  'datadefs.bi'
        ' $STATIC $INCLUDE: 'datadefs.bi'
        '     $STATIC    $INCLUDE :  'datadefs.bi'
 
      Note that no spaces appear between the dollar sign and the rest of
      the metacommand.
    ■ If you want to refer to a metacommand in a description but do not
      want it to execute, place a character that is not a tab or space
      before the first dollar sign on the line. For example, on the
      following line both metacommands are ignored:
 
        REM x$STATIC $INCLUDE:  'datadefs.bi'

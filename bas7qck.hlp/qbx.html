<b>QBX [/AH] [/B] [/C:buffersize] [{/Ea | /Es}] [/E:n] [/G] [/H]</b>
    [/K:[keyfile]] [/L [libraryname]] [/MBF] [/Nof[rills]] [/NOHI]
    [[/RUN] programname] [/CMD string]
 
These options can be typed on the operating system command line following
the QBX command:
 
<b>Option              Description</b>
 
/AH                 Allows dynamic arrays of records, fixed-length strings,
                    and numeric data to be larger than 64K each. If /AH
                    is not specified, the maximum size is 64K per dynamic
                    array.
 
/B                  Allows the use of a composite (black-and-white) monitor
                    with a color graphics card. The /B option displays
                    QBX in black and white if you have a color monitor.
 
/C: buffersize      Sets the size of the buffer receiving data. This option
                    works only with an asynchronous communications card.
                    The default buffer size is 512 bytes; the maximum size
                    is 32,767 bytes.
 
/Ea                 Allows arrays to be moved into expanded memory. /Ea
                    affects arrays with sizes between 512 bytes and
                    16 kilobytes, inclusive (with the exception of
                    variable-length string arrays, which are never moved
                    into expanded memory). If /Ea is not specified, no
                    arrays are moved into expanded memory.
 
                    Do not use /Ea if you pass arrays as parameters to
                    mixed-language Quick library routines. Do not use /Ea
                    with the /Es option.
 
                    When you invoke QBX with /Ea and /L, the specified
                    Quick library must have been compiled with the BC /Ah
                    or /D switch. This is necessary because /Ah and /D
                    cause run-time calls instead of inline code
                    generation for array references.
 
/E:n                Limits the amount of expanded memory used by QBX, where
                    n is the amount of memory in kilobytes. If /E:n is not
                    specified, all available expanded memory may be used.
                    A value of 0 disables use of expanded memory by QBX, and
                    can improve the execution speed of some QBX operations.
 
/Es                 Allows you to share expanded memory between QBX and
                    Quick libraries or mixed-language routines that make use
                    of expanded memory. Specify /Es when you are using a
                    Quick library or mixed-language routine that makes use
                    of expanded memory. Do not use /Es with the /Ea option.
 
/G                  Sets QBX to update a CGA screen as fast as possible.
                    The option works only with machines using CGA
                    monitors. If you see snow (dots flickering on the
                    screen) when QBX updates your screen, then your
                    hardware cannot fully support the /G option. If you
                    prefer a clean screen, restart QBX without this option.
 
/H                  Displays the highest resolution possible on your
                    hardware.
 
/K:[keyfile]        Specifies a user-configurable key file to be loaded
                    into QBX. A key file has a .KEY filename extension,
                    and defines key mappings that will be used while
                    editing a file in QBX.
 
/L [libraryname]    Loads the Quick library that is specified by libraryname.
                    If libraryname is not specified, the default Quick
                    library, QBX.QLB, is loaded.
 
/MBF                Causes the QBX conversion functions to treat
                    IEEE-format numbers as Microsoft Binary format numbers.
 
/Nof                Causes QBX to use about 19K less memory, freeing this
                    memory for other uses during program development. These
                    features are unavailable when /Nof is in use:
                    Utility menu and commands, Options menu and commands,
                    and Help menu and commands.
 
/NOHI               Allows the use of a monitor that does not support high
                    intensity. Not for use with Compaq laptop computers.
 
programname         Names the file to be loaded when QBX starts.
 
/RUN [programname]  Causes QBX to load and run the program before
                    displaying it.
 
/CMD string         Passes string to the COMMAND$ function. This option
                    must be the last option on the line.

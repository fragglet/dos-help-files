    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

                   position.
Beep               Causes the computer to beep, usually when an unassigned
                   key is pressed.
BegLine            Moves the cursor to the beginning of the line (column
                   1), ignoring any indentation.
BegPgm             Moves the cursor to the beginning of the program (line
                   1, column 1).
Cancel             Closes Help windows and cancels dialog boxes.
Cancel2            Cancels menus.
Change             Searches for selected text and changes it to something
                   else.

                   white space character.
DoEsc              Cancels the current selected text.
DoQuoteCharacter   Inserts the next typed character into the text (except
                   carriage returns, linefeeds, and nulls). This allows
                   you to insert characters such as Ctrl+C.

                   shifted DoTab removes the tabs from a block.

                   current line.

                   maintaining the current column position.

                   beeping as it does for undefined keys.

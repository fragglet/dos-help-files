<b>BC sourcefile [objectfile] [listingfile] [optionlist] [;]</b>
 
These arguments can be typed on the operating system command line following
the BC command:
 
<b>Argument        Description</b>
 
sourcefile      The name of your BASIC source code file. If USER is
                specified, input is taken from the keyboard.
 
objectfile      The name of the object file you are creating.
 
listingfile     The name of the file that will contain an assembly-code
                source listing of the compiler-generated code. The file
                contains the address of each line in your source file,
                the text of the source file, its size, and any error
                messages produced during compilation. If USER is specified,
                the listing is sent to the screen.
 
optionlist      One or more of the following command-line options:
 
<b>Option          Description</b>
 
/?              Displays compiler syntax and options.
 
/A              Creates a listing of the disassembled object code for each
                source line and shows the assembly language code generated
                by the compiler.
 
/Ah             Allows dynamic arrays of records, fixed-length strings,
                and numeric data to be larger than 64K each. If /Ah is not
                specified, the maximum size is 64K per dynamic array.
 
                Be sure to use either /Ah or /D when you are compiling
                Quick library routines that will be loaded into QBX with
                the /Ea option (which moves arrays into expanded memory).
                This is necessary because /Ah and /D cause run-time calls
                instead of inline code generation for array references.
 
/C:buffersize   Sets the size of the buffer receiving remote data for each
                communications port when using an asynchronous
                communications adapter.
 
/D              Generates debugging code for run-time error checking and
                enables Ctrl+Break. For ISAM programs, causes BASIC to
                write open database buffers to disk after every DELETE,
                INSERT, UPDATE, or CLOSE statement.
 
                Be sure to use either /D or /Ah when you are compiling
                Quick library routines that will be loaded into QBX with
                the /Ea option (which moves arrays into expanded memory).
                This is necessary because /D and /Ah cause run-time calls
                instead of in-line code generation for array references.
 
/E              Specifies presence of ON ERROR with RESUME linenumber
                statements. (See also the discussion of the /X option
                in this list.)
 
/Es             Allows you to share expanded memory between BASIC and
                mixed-language routine(s) that make use of expanded memory.
                Specify /Es when you are going to use a mixed-language
                routine that makes use of expanded memory.
 
/FBr [filename] Generates a file containing restricted program symbol
                information for use with the Programmer's WorkBench Source
                Browser. This information file has the name  specified by
                the filename argument. If no name is specified, it has
                the same name as the source file with an .SBR filename
                extension. The file contains information about the
                definitions and references to all global symbols.
 
/FBx [filename] Generates a file containing extended program symbol
                information for use with the Programmer's WorkBench Source
                Browser. This information file has the name specified by
                the filename argument. If no name is specified, it has
                the same name as the source file with an .SBR filename
                extension. The file contains information about the
                definitions and references to all global and local symbols.
 
/FPa            Causes your program to use the alternate-math library for
                floating-point operations.
 
/FPi            Causes the compiler to generate in-line instructions for
                use in floating-point operations.
 
/Fs             Enables far strings in user programs.
 
/G2             Enables 80286-specific instructions.
 
/Help           Displays online Help for compiler syntax and options.
 
/Ib             Sets the minimum number of buffers to be used by ISAM. ISAM
                defaults to 6 buffers for reduced functionality (PROISAM)
                and 9 for full functionality (PROISAMD). The maximum
                allowable value is 512.
 
/Ie             Sets the amount of expanded memory, in kilobytes, to
                leave for non-ISAM use when you are working with ISAM.
                If omitted, all expanded memory (up to about 1.2 megabytes)
                is used by ISAM. A value of -1 indicates ISAM should use
                no expanded memory.
 
/Ii             Specifies the number of non-NULL ISAM indexes used in a
                program. If omitted, the default is 30, which is the
                minimum value. The maximum allowable value is 500.
 
/Lp             Creates a protected-mode object file; the default if
                running BC from an OS/2 protected-mode session.
 
/Lr             Creates a real-mode object file; the default if running
                BC from DOS or an OS/2 real-mode session.
 
/MBF            Allows your BASIC program to read and write floating-point
                values stored in Microsoft Binary format. The intrinsic
                functions MKS$, MKD$, CVS, and CVD are converted to MKSMBF$,
                MKDMBF$, CVSMBF, and CVDMBF, respectively.
 
/O              Substitutes the default stand-alone library for the
                default run-time library (creates a stand-alone executable
                file that can run without a BASIC run-time module).
 
/Ot             Optimizes execution speed for SUB and FUNCTION procedures,
                and DEF FN statements if certain conditions are met. (For
                conditions, see the Microsoft BASIC Programmer's Guide).
 
/R              Stores arrays in row-major order. BASIC normally stores
                arrays in column-major order.
 
/S              Writes quoted strings to the object file instead of the
                symbol table. Use this option when an Out of Memory error
                message occurs in a program that has many string constants.
 
/T              Suppresses warnings given by the compiler. By default, the
                interpreter passes this option to BC when you select Make
                EXE File from the environment.
 
/V              Enables event trapping for communications (COM), lightpen
                (PEN), joystick (STRIG), timer (TIMER), music buffer
                (PLAY), function keys (KEY), OS/2 signal events (SIGNAL),
                and user-defined events (UEVENT). Checks between each BASIC
                statement for events.
 
/W              Enables event trapping for the same statements as /V, but
                checks at each line number or label for occurrence of an
                event.
 
/X              Specifies presence of ON ERROR with RESUME, RESUME NEXT, or
                RESUME 0.
 
/Z              Produces a listing of compile-time errors in a form readable
                by the M editor. If used when compiling within M, /Z allows
                you to locate and scroll through errors in your source and
                include files by invoking the nxtmsg editor function.
 
/Zd             Produces an object file containing line-number records
                for debugging purposes corresponding to the line numbers
                of the source file.
 
/Zi             Adds debugging information to the object file that can be
                used by the Microsoft CodeView debugger.

<b>Symbolic Constants</b>
 
BASIC provides symbolic constants that can be used in place of numeric or
string values. The following fragment declares two symbolic constants and
uses one to dimension an array:
 
  CONST MAXCHARS% = 254, MAXBUF% = MAXCHARS% + 1
  DIM Buffer%(MAXBUF%)
 
The name of a symbolic constant follows the same rules as a BASIC variable
name. You may include a type-declaration character (%, &amp;, #, !, @, or $)
in the name to indicate its type, but this character is not part of the name.
For example, after the following declaration, the names N!, N#, N$, N%, N&amp;,
and N@ cannot be used as variable names because they have the same name as
the constant:
 
  CONST N=45
 
A constant's type is determined either by an explicit type-declaration
character or the type of the expression. Symbolic constants are unaffected
by DEFtype statements.
 
If you omit the type-declaration character, the constant is given a type
based on the expression. Strings always yield a string constant. With
numeric expressions, the expression is evaluated and the constant is given
the simplest type that can represent it. For example, if the expression
gives a result that can be represented as an integer, the constant is given
an integer type.

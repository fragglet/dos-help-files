  Argument
 
    options    CSTRING specifying font characteristics
 
  Returns
 
    Integer    Font number if successful; otherwise, a negative number
 
  Description
 
    The _SetFont procedure searches the set of registered fonts for a
    font with the characteristics specified by the options string. If
    a matching font is found, it becomes the current font for output
    with _OutGText, and the font number is returned.
 
    The options string is a set of characters that specifies the
    desired font characteristics. Characteristics that may be
    specified are listed below. The command characters are neither
    case nor position sensitive.
 
      Characteristic    Description
      ══════════════    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
      t ''fontname''    Typeface
      h&lt;number&gt;         Character height in number of pixels
      w&lt;number&gt;         Character width in number of pixels
      f                 Fixed-space font (should not be used with p)
      p                 Proportionally spaced font (should not be used
                        with f)
      v                 Vector font (should not be used with r)
      r                 Raster (bit-mapped) font (should not be used
                        with v)
      b                 Best-fit font
      n&lt;number&gt;         Font number, where &lt;number&gt; is greater than 0
                        and less than or equal to the value returned by
                        the _RegisterFonts function
 
    In general, as many options may be requested as desired. If mutually
    exclusive options are requested, such as the pair f/p or r/v,
    _SetFont ignores them.
 
    For vector fonts, _SetFont allows the h and w options to be used
    with the n option. It ignores other options used with n for vector
    fonts and ignores any options used with n for raster fonts.
 
    Options can be separated in the option string by blanks. Characters
    other than those listed above are ignored. The typeface
    specification in the option string is specified as a T, followed
    by the type name in single quotes. To embed single quotes inside
    Pascal strings, follow the closing quote with another single quote.
    The typeface name may be any of the following valid fonts:
 
      Type Name    Description
      ═════════    ══════════════════════════════════════════════
      Courier      Fixed-width bit-mapped font with serifs
      Helv         Proportional bit-mapped font without serifs
      Tms Rmn      Proportional bit-mapped font with serifs
      Script       Proportional vector-mapped font of slanted
                   characters formed from nearly continuous lines
      Modern       Proportional vector-mapped font without serifs
      Roman        Proportional vector-mapped font with serifs
 
    A b in the option field causes _SetFont to automatically select
    the "best fit" font -- the one providing the best match to
    specified characteristics. If the b parameter is specified and at
    least one font is registered, _SetFont can always set a font and
    will return the font number to indicate success.
 
    In selecting a font, _SetFont uses the following precedence:
 
      1. Pixel height
      2. Typeface
      3. Pixel width
      4. Fixed or proportional font
 
    A smaller font takes precedence over a larger, given two choices
    equally close to the requested size. If _SetFont requests Helv 12
    with best fit, and only Helv 10 and Helv 14 are available, _SetFont
    will select Helv 10.
 
    The n option can be used for cycling through all registered fonts.
    Because .FON files often contain several fonts and files are loaded
    into memory in the reverse order in which they were registered, it
    is sometimes difficult to know which font will be the given number.
    If successful, however, _SetFont returns the number of the selected
    font, which can be used with the n parameter on subsequent calls to
    _SetFont.
 
    If nonexistent values are chosen for pixel height and width,
    _SetFont will apply a magnification factor to a vector-mapped
    font to obtain a suitable font size. However, this automatic
    magnification is inapplicable if the raster-mapped font (r) option
    is specified, or if a particular typeface is requested and no
    best-fit (b) option is specified.
 
    Note:  The font functions affect only the output from _OutGText;
    no other output functions are affected.
 
    An error occurs if a request for a specific font fails and
    option b was not specified. An error also occurs if no fonts have
    been registered, or if there is insufficient memory to load
    the font. If _SetFont fails, it returns a negative number. Use
    _GrStatus to determine the nature of the error.
 
  _GrStatus Returns
 
    _GrError, _GrFontFileNotFound, _GrInsufficientMemory,
    _GrParameterAltered

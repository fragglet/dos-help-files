  Arguments
 
    startpoint    Specifies point where arc begins
 
    endpoint      Specifies point where arc ends
 
    fillpoint     Specifies point where pie fill would begin
 
  Returns
 
    Boolean       False is returned if neither _Arc or _Pie has been
                  successfully called since the last time the screen
                  was cleared or a new graphics mode or viewport was
                  selected; otherwise, true
 
  Description
 
    If successful, the _GetArcInfo function updates the startpoint and
    endpoint _XYCoord records to contain the endpoints (in viewport
    coordinates) of the arc drawn by the most recent call to _Arc (or
    _Pie). In addition, fillpoint specifies a point from which a pie
    can be filled. This is useful for filling a pie in a different
    color than the border color. After a call to _GetArcInfo, you
    would change colors using the _SetColor procedure, and use the
    coordinates in fillpoint and the old color as arguments for the
    _FloodFill procedure.
 
  _GrStatus Returns
 
    _GrError, _GrNotInProperMode

  Argument
 
    style    Bits of this word determine the line pattern
 
  Description
 
    Some graphics routines (_LineTo, _Rectangle) draw straight lines
    on the screen. The type of line is controlled by the current
    line-style mask.
 
    The _SetLineStyle procedure selects the mask used for line drawing.
    The mask is a 16-bit number, where each bit represents a pixel
    in the line being drawn. If a bit is 1, the corresponding pixel
    is set to the current color of the line. If a bit is 0, the
    corresponding pixel is left unchanged. The template is repeated
    for the entire length of the line. The default mask is $FFFF (a
    solid line).

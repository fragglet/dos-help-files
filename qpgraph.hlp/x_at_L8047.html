    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

  Arguments
 
    x, y      Viewport coordinates of upper-left corner of image
 
    wx, wy    Window coordinates for upper-left corner of image
 
    image     Memory buffer containing image previously stored by
              _GetImage
 
    action    _GAND, _GOR, _GXOR, _GPSET, or _GPRESET
 
  Description
 
    The _PutImage procedures transfer the image stored in the buffer
    to the screen. In _PutImage, the upper-left corner of the image is
    placed at viewport coordinate (x,y). In _PutImage_w, the upper-
    left corner of the image is placed at window coordinate (wx,wy).
    If the image does not completely fit in the current clipping
    region, it is not transferred.
 
    The action argument defines the interaction between the stored
    image and the one already on the screen. The five options are
    described below:
 
      Constant    Meaning
      ════════    ════════════════════════════════════════════════════
      _GAND       Transfers the image over the top of an existing
                  image on the screen. The resulting image is the
                  logical AND product of the two images.
 
      _GOR        Superimposes the image over the top of an existing
                  image, but the new image does not erase the previous
                  screen contents. The resulting image is the logical
                  sum of the two images.
 
      _GPRESET    Transfers the image point by point onto the screen.
                  Each point has the inverse of the color attribute
                  it had when taken from the screen by _GetImage,
                  producing a negative image.
 
      _GPSET      Transfers the image point by point onto the screen.
                  Each point has the same color attribute it had
                  when taken from the screen by _GetImage.
 
      _GXOR       Causes the points of the existing image on the
                  screen to be inverted when the same point exists in
                  the image buffer. The resulting image is the
                  logical XOR sum of the two images. This behavior
                  is exactly like that of the cursor; namely, when an
                  image is put against a complex background twice, the
                  background is restored unchanged. This allows you
                  to move an object around without erasing the
                  background. _GXOR is often used for animation.
 
  _GrStatus Returns
 
    _GrError, _GrInvalidImageBuffer, _GrInvalidParameter,
    _GrNotInProperMode

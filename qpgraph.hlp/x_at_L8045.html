  Arguments
 
    control       _GFillInterior or _GBorder
 
    x1, y1        Upper-left corner of the bounding rectangle
 
    x2, y2        Lower-right corner of the bounding rectangle
 
    x3, y3        Arc begins at the intersection with a line which
                  starts at the rectangle's center and passes through
                  this point
 
    x4, y4        Arc ends at the intersection with a line which starts
                  at the rectangle's center and passes through this
                  point
 
    wxy1, wxy2    Window coordinates of bounding rectangle
 
    wxy3, wxy4    Lines extending from the rectangle's center pass
                  through these points
 
  Description
 
    The _Pie procedures draw a pie-shaped wedge by drawing an elliptical
    arc whose center and two endpoints are joined by solid lines.
 
    _Pie uses the view coordinate system. The center of the arc is the
    center of the bounding rectangle specified by view coordinates
    (x1,y1) and (x2,y2). The arc starts where it intersects an
    imaginary line extending from the center of the arc through
    (x3, y3). It is drawn counterclockwise about the center of the
    bounding rectangle, ending where it intersects an imaginary line
    extending from the center of the arc through (x4,y4).
 
    _Pie_wxy uses the window coordinate system. The center of the arc
    is the center of the bounding rectangle specified by window
    coordinate pairs wxy1 and wxy2. The arc starts where it intersects
    an imaginary line extending from the center of the rectangle and
    passing through the points wxy3. Then the arc is drawn counter-
    clockwise and ends where it intersects an imaginary line extending
    from the center of the arc through wxy4.
 
    The wedge is drawn using the current color. The control option
    given by the _GFillInterior option is equivalent to calling the
    _FloodFill procedure after the pie has been drawn, using the
    current color (set by the _SetColor procedure) as the boundary
    color.
 
  _GrStatus Returns

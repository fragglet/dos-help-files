    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

[netname.versions]
<i>ooMMmmrr=description,search-file,work-section,work-section2</i>
 
The [netname.versions] section contains a list identifying the different
version of a network that can be installed. The netname in the section title
must be the same as a netname given in the [network] section of the
information file.
 
<b>Parameter      Description</b>
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
 
<i>oo</i>             Specfies a two-digit option code. For example, Microsoft LAN
               Manager uses option code 00 to indicate the basic
               configuration and 01 to indicate the 386 enhanced
               configuration. The option can be an number or xx if an option
               code is not needed.
 
<i>MM</i>             Specifies a two-digit major version number.
 
<i>mm</i>             Specifies a two-digit minor version number.
 
<i>rr</i>             Specifies the revision number.
 
<i>description</i>    Specifies an ASCII string that describes the version for the
               corresponding network driver. This parameter must be enclosed
               in double quotation marks (").
 
<i>search-file</i>    Specifies the name of a file. This parameter can be left
               blank. If it is not, Setup searches for the specified file
               and uses the result of the search to determine whether to use
               the work-section or work-section2 parameter to complete the
               installation. If search-file is left blank, Setup uses the
               work-section parameter to complete the installation.
 
<i>work-section</i>   Specifies the name of the section that defines how to install
               support for the network. Setup uses this section only if the
               search-file parameter is empty or the file specified by
               search-file could not be found.
 
<i>work-section2</i>  Specifies the name of the section that defines how to install
               support for the network. Setup uses this section only if the
               file specified by search-file is found.
 
<b>Comments</b>
 
For an OEM-supplied OEMSETUP.INF file, the version number used on the left
side of the equal sign is not critical; the values are important only when
Setup performs detection for the network during a first-time install. Setup
defaults to the highest numbered version in SETUP.INF that is less than or
equal to the detected version, provided that the option field matches or is
xx.
 
Each work section has the following form:
 
[work-section]
<i>line</i>
    .
    .
    .
 
Each line may define a file or initialization setting for the network. For a
complete description of the lines, see the "Work Section Lines" section.
 
<b>Example</b>
 
The following example supports three versions of the network. Each version
has a version-specific work section. The last version specifies a a file
(V2ENH.EXE) to search for and also two work sections.
 
[networks]
mynet=,"My Network"
 
[mynet.versions]
00010000="Version 1.00",,my ver1
00020000="Version 2.00",,my ver2
01020000="Version 2.00 ENHANCED",v2enh.exe,my_ver2,my_ver2_plus
 
When installing with this example, the user will choose from:
 
My Network (Version 1.00)
My Network (Version 2.00)
My Network (Version 2.00 ENHANCED)
 
<b>Work section lines</b>
 
A work section may contain any of the following lines, in any order:
 
<i>section,tag,value</i>
system.ini=section,tag,value
win.ini=section,tag,value
driver=drive:filename
vxd=drive:filename,...
sysdir=drive:filename,...
windir=drive:filename,...
update=drive:filename,...
warning=level
 
Each line is described in detail in subsequent sections.
 
The drive specifier refers to one of the disks defined in the OEMSETUP.INF
file. Filenames should appear without a path. In all such lines (except
driver), all files listed in all sections are copied. For example, a vxd
line in the version-specific section will add VxDs to any VxD listed in
another work-section, or the [networks] section. In general, when using
version-specific work sections, all files copied should be defined in that
section, and the other sections and [networks] section line should be
empty.
 
Setup carries out standard Windows version checking when copying files if
the specified files are Windows-format executables.
 
<b>Initialization line</b>
 
<i>section,tag,value</i>
 
This line updates one of two initialization files. If the work-section is
specified by the WinIniSect of the network line in the [network] section,
the modification is applied to WIN.INI. Otherwise, the modification is
applied to SYSTEM.INI.
 
If this line specifies the load setting in the [windows] section of WIN.INI
or the drivers setting in the [boot] section of SYSTEM.INI, Setup appends
the value to the current setting value. All other tags are replaced.
 
In the case of the device setting in the [386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI,
settings are not replaced; a new line will be added. In general, VxDs should
always appear on the VXD=command setting so that Setup can remove them
correctly should the network installation be modified using Maintenance Mode
Setup.
 
The following example puts the setting "TimerCriticalSection=1000" in the
[386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI.
 
386Enh,TimerCriticalSection,1000
 
<b>SYSTEM.INI line</b>
 
system.ini=section,tag,value
 
This line modifies a setting in SYSTEM.INI. For example, the following line
adds the setting "UniqueDOSPSP=1" to the [386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI.
 
system.ini=386Enh,UniqueDOSPSP,1
 
<b>WIN.INI line</b>
 
win.ini=section,tag,value
 
This line modified a setting in WIN.INI. For example, the following line
appends "mybcast.exe" to the load setting in the [windows] section of
WIN.INI.
 
win.ini=windows,load,mybcast.exe
 
<b>DRIVER line</b>
 
driver=drive:filename
 
This line sets the network driver in the [boot] section in SYSTEM.INI, and
copies the file from the disk to the SYSTEM directory. If a driver is
defined in more than one place in the OEMSETUP.INF file, Setup checks each
of the following sections or parameters (in the given order) until it finds
the name of a driver to copy:
 
♦  The work-section specified by the [netname.versions] section.
 
♦  The section specified by the SysIniSect parameter in the [network]
   section.
 
♦  The section specified by the WinIniSect parameter in the [network]
   section.
 
♦  The Filename specified by the [network] section.
 
The following example copies MYNET.DRV from the [disks] section of
OEMSETUP.INF to the SYSTEM directory, and adds the setting
"network.drv=mynet.drv" to the [boot] section of SYSTEM.INI.
 
driver=9:mynet.drv
 
<b>VXD line</b>
 
vxd=drive:filename,...
 
This line adds one or more VxDs to SYSTEM.INI and copies the files to the
SYSTEM directory, unless the VxD is internal to WIN386. For example, the
following line copies MYNET.386 from the [disks] section of OEMSETUP.INF to
the SYSTEM directory, and adds the setting
"network=mynet.386,*dosnet,*vnetbios" to the [386Enh] section of
SYSTEM.INI.
 
vxd=9:mynet.386,x:*dosnet,x:*vnetbios
 
<b>SYSDIR line</b>
 
sysdir=drive:filename,...
 
This line copies one or more files to the SYSTEM directory. For example, the
following line copies MYNETLIB.DLL to the SYSTEM directory from disk as
defined in the OEMSETUP.INF file.
 
sysdir=9:mynetlib.dll
 
<b>WINDIR line</b>
 
windir=drive:filename,...
 
This line copies one or more files from disk to the WINDOWS directory. For
example, the following line copies the Help file for the driver to the
WINDOWS directory.
 
windir=9:mynet.hlp
 
<b>UPDATE line</b>
 
update=drive:filename,...
 
This line replaces a file found on the path, or, if not found, copies it to
the Windows directory. This allows Setup to update a network component
shipped with the network software in place. The following example searches
for V2ENH.EXE on the path. If found, a new version of the file is copied.
 
update=9:v2enh.exe
 
<b>WARNING line</b>
 
warning=level
 
This setting produces a warning dialog box. The level can be one of the
following values.
 
<b>Value  Meaning</b>
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
<i>1</i>      Indicates that the network is not compatible with Windows.
 
<i>2</i>      Indicates the network software is compatible, but updated software
       may be available.
 
<i>3</i>      Indicates that the network software is compatible, but some part of
       it is missing. Level 3 is generally used in a work-section when a
       search file is not found, so the user can be notified that they are
       missing that file.

              DC_BINNAMES             Copies an array containing a list of
                                      the names of the paper bins. This
                                      array is in the form char
                                      PaperNames[cBinMax][cchBinName] where
                                      cchBinName is 24. If the lpszOutput
                                      parameter is NULL, the return value is
                                      the number of bin entries required.
                                      Otherwise, the return value is the
                                      number of bins copied. To work
                                      properly with the common dialog box
                                      library (COMMDLG), a printer driver
                                      for Windows 3.1 must support the
                                      DC_BINNAMES index.
 
              DC_BINS                 Retrieves a list of available bins.
                                      The function copies the list to
                                      lpOutput as a WORD array. If lpOutput
                                      is NULL, the function returns the
                                      number of supported bins to allow the
                                      application the opportunity to
                                      allocate a buffer with the correct
                                      size. See the description of the
                                      dmDefaultSource member of the DEVMODE
                                      structure for information on these
                                      values. An application can determine
                                      the name of device-specific bins by
                                      using the ENUMPAPERBINS escape.
 
              DC_COPIES               Returns the maximum number of copies
                                      the device can produce.
 
              DC_DRIVER               Returns the printer-driver version
                                      number.
 
              DC_DUPLEX               Returns the level of duplex support.
                                      The function returns 1 if the printer
                                      is capable of duplex printing.
                                      Otherwise, the return value is zero.
 
              DC_ENUMRESOLUTIONNAMES  Retrieves a list of resolution names
                                      supported by the model. The
                                      application should allocate a buffer
                                      to hold one or more arrays each
                                      containing CCHPAPERNAME (64) bytes. If
                                      lpOutput is NULL, the function returns
                                      the number of resolutions supported by
                                      the model. If lpOutput is not NULL,
                                      the buffer is filled in.
 
              DC_ENUMRESOLUTIONS      Returns a list of available
                                      resolutions. If lpOutput is NULL, the
                                      function returns the number of
                                      available resolution configurations.
                                      Resolutions are represented by pairs
                                      of LONG integers representing the
                                      horizontal and vertical resolutions.
 
              DC_EXTRA                Returns the number of bytes required
                                      for the device-specific portion of the
                                      DEVMODE structure for the printer
                                      driver.
 
              DC_FIELDS               Returns the dmFields member of the
                                      printer driver's DEVMODE data
                                      structure. The dmFields member
                                      indicates which member in the
                                      device-independent portion of the
                                      structure are supported by the printer
                                      driver.
 
              DC_FILEDEPENDENCIES     Returns a list of files which also
                                      need to be loaded when a driver is
                                      installed. If lpOutput is NULL, the
                                      function returns the number of files.
                                      If lpOutput is not NULL, it is a
                                      pointer to an array of filenames. Each
                                      element in the array is exactly 64
                                      characters long.
 
              DC_MAXEXTENT            Returns a POINT structure containing
                                      the maximum paper size that the
                                      dmPaperLength and dmPaperWidth members
                                      of the printer driver's DEVMODE
                                      structure can specify.
 
              DC_MINEXTENT            Returns a POINT structure containing
                                      the minimum paper size that the
                                      dmPaperLength and dmPaperWidth members
                                      of the printer driver's DEVMODE
                                      structure can specify.
 
              DC_ORIENTATION          Retrieves the relationship between
                                      portrait and landscape orientations in
                                      terms of the number of degrees that
                                      portrait orientation is to be rotated
                                      counterclock-wise to get landscape
                                      orientation. It can be one of the
                                      following values.
 
                                      Value  Meaning
                                      ──────────────────────────────────────
                                      0      No landscape orientation.
 
                                      90     Portrait is rotated 90 degrees
                                             to produce landscapes. (For
                                             example, PCL.)
 
                                      270    Portrait is rotated 270 degrees
                                             to produce landscape. (For
                                             example, dot-matrix printers.)
 
              DC_PAPERNAMES           Retrieves a list of the nonstandard
                                      paper names supported by the model.
                                      The application should allocate a
                                      buffer to hold one or more arrays each
                                      containing CCHPAPERNAME (64) bytes. If
                                      lpOutput is NULL, the function returns
                                      the number of non-standard paper sizes
                                      supported by the model. If lpOutput is
                                      not NULL, the buffer is filled in.
 
              DC_PAPERS               Retrieves a list of supported paper
                                      sizes. The function copies the list to
                                      lpOutput as a WORD array and returns
                                      the number of entries in the array. If
                                      lpOutput is NULL, the function returns
                                      the number of supported paper sizes to
                                      allow the application the opportunity
                                      to allocate a buffer with the correct
                                      size. See the description of the
                                      dmPaperSize member of the DEVMODE data
                                      structure for information on these
                                      values.
 
              DC_PAPERSIZE            Copies the dimensions of supported
                                      paper sizes in tenths of a millimeter
                                      to an array of POINT structures
                                      pointed to by lpOutput. This allows an
                                      application to obtain information
                                      about nonstandard paper sizes.
 
              DC_SIZE                 Returns the dmSize member of the
                                      printer driver's DEVMODE data
                                      structure.
 
              DC_TRUETYPE             Retrieves the driver's capabilities
                                      with regard to printing TrueType
                                      fonts. The return value can be one or
                                      more of the following capability
                                      flags.

                                      DCTT_BITMAP    (0x0000001L) Device is
                                                     capable of printing
                                                     TrueType fonts as
                                                     graphics.
 
                                      DCTT_DOWNLOAD  (0x0000002L) Device is
                                                     capable of downloading
                                                     TrueType fonts.
 
                                      DCTT_SUBDEV    (0x0000004L) Device is
                                                     capable of substituting
                                                     device fonts for
                                                     TrueType.
 
                                      In this case, the lpOutput parameter
                                      is not used, and should be NULL.
 
              DC_VERSION              Returns the specification version to
                                      which the printer driver conforms.
 
<i>lpOutput</i>      Points to an array of bytes. The actual format of the array
              depends on the setting of the nIndex parameter. If set to
              zero, DeviceCapabilities returns the number of bytes required
              for the output data.
 
<i>lpDevMode     Points to a DEVMODE structure. </i>If the lpDevMode parameter is
              NULL, this function retrieves the current default
              initialization values for the specified printer driver.
              Otherwise, the function retrieves the values contained in the
              structure to which lpDevMode points.
 
<b>Return Value</b>
 
The return value depends on the setting of the nIndex parameter if
successful. Otherwise, the return value is -1 if the function fails.
 
<b>Comments</b>
 
The export ordinal for this function is 91.

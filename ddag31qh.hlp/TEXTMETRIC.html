The TEXTMETRIC structure contains a list of the basic metrics of a physical
font.
 
<b>Member              Description</b>
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
<b>tmHeight</b>            Specifies the height of the character cell. This member
                    is equal to the sum of the tmAscent and tmDescent
                    members.
 
<b>tmAscent</b>            Specifies the ascent of the character cell, that is,
                    height of the cell measured from the baseline.
 
<b>tmDescent</b>           Specifies the descent of the character cell, that is,
                    the height of the cell measured from the baseline to the
                    bottom of the cell.
 
<b>tmInternalLeading</b>   Specifies the amount of internal leading. It is equal to
                    the difference between the cell height (as expressed by
                    the tmHeight member) and the maximum height of any
                    character in the font (excluding the height of accent
                    marks).
 
<b>tmExternalLeading</b>   Specifies the recommended amount of leading for the
                    font.
 
<b>tmAveCharWidth</b>      Specifies the average width of characters in the font
                    (loosely defined as the width of the letter "X").
 
<b>tmMaxCharWidth</b>      Specifies the maximum width of any character in the
                    font.
 
<b>tmWeight</b>            Specifies the weight of the font.
 
<b>tmItalic</b>            If nonzero, specifies an italic font.
 
<b>tmUnderlined</b>        If nonzero, specifies an underlined font.
 
<b>tmStruckOut</b>         If nonzero, specifies a font that has been struck
                    through.
 
<b>tmFirstChar</b>         Specifies the value of the first character defined in
                    the font.
 
<b>tmLastChar</b>          Specifies the value of the last character defined in the
                    font.
 
<b>tmDefaultChar</b>       Specifies the value of the character that is to be
                    substituted for characters that are not in the font.
 
<b>tmBreakChar</b>         Specifies the value of the character that is to be used
                    to define word breaks for text justification.
 
<b>tmPitchAndFamily</b>    Specifies the font pitch and font family. This member is
                    a combination of one pitch and one family value. The
                    pitch value can be any one of the following values.
 
                    Value                  Meaning
                    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                    DEFAULT_PITCH (0x00)   Chooses a reasonable font.
 
                    FIXED_PITCH (0x01)     Chooses a fixed-pitch font.
 
                    VARIABLE_PITCH (0x02)  Chooses a variable-pitch font.
 
                    The font family, which describes in a general way the
                    look of a font, can be any one of the following values.
 
                    Value                 Meaning
                    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                    FF_DONTCARE (0x00)    Chooses a reasonable font.
 
                    FF_ROMAN (0x10)       Chooses a variable-pitch font with
                                          serifs.
 
                    FF_SWISS (0x20)       Chooses a variable-pitch fonts
                                          without serifs.
 
                    FF_MODERN (0x30)      Chooses a fixed-pitch font.
 
                    FF_SCRIPT (0x40)      Chooses a cursive or script font.
 
                    FF_DECORATIVE (0x50)  Chooses a novelty font.
 
<b>tmCharSet</b>           Specifies the character set of the font. It can be one
                    of the following values.
 
                    Value                  Meaning
                    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                    ANSI_CHARSET (0x00)    Indicates the ANSI character
                                           set.
 
                    SYMBOL_CHARSET (0x02)  Indicates the Symbol character
                                           set.
 
                    OEM_CHARSET (0xFF)     Indicates an OEM-specific
                                           character set. The characters and
                                           corresponding character codes
                                           depend on the computer.
 
<b>tmOverhang</b>          Specifies the amount of additional, synthesized width of
                    a character or character string. This member may be is
                    nonzero if the driver synthesizes character attributes,
                    such as bold or italic, by modifying an existing font.
 
<b>tmDigitizedAspectX</b>  Specifies the horizontal aspect ratio for which this
                    font was designed. This member is equal to the
                    dfHorizRes member of the FONTINFO structure.
 
<b>tmDigitizedAspectY</b>  Specifies the vertical aspect ratio for which this font
                    was designed. This member is equal to the dfVertRes
                    member of the FONTINFO structure.
 
<b>Comments</b>
 
GDI makes a string bold by expanding the intracharacter spacing and
overstriking with an offset; the overhang is the distance by which the
overstrike is offset. GDI italicizes a font by skewing the string, and the
overhang is the amount the top of the font is skewed past the bottom of the
font.

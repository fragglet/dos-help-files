    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully

The LFONT structure contains the logical attributes for a font.
 
<b>Member            Description</b>
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
<b>lfHeight</b>          Specifies the height of the font in device units. If this
                  member is greater than zero, the driver should choose a
                  font whose cell height matches the given height. If this
                  member is zero, the driver should choose a font having a
                  reasonable default size. If this member is less than zero,
                  the driver should choose a font whose character height
                  (that is, cell height less internal leading) matches the
                  absolute value of this member. In all cases, the driver
                  should choose the largest font that does not exceed the
                  requested height and, if there is no such font, choose the
                  next smallest font available.
 
<b>lfWidth</b>           Specifies the average width of characters in the font in
                  device units. If this member is zero, the driver should
                  choose an available font whose digitization aspect ratio
                  (the dfVertRes member of the FONTINFO structure) most
                  closely matches the aspect ratio of the device (the
                  dpAspectY member in the GDIINFO structure). When comparing
                  fonts, the driver should compare the absolute values of
                  the differences between the digitization aspect ratio and
                  the device aspect ratio.
 
<b>lfEscapement      Specifies the angl</b>e, counterclockwise from the x-axis in
                  tenths of a degree, of the vector passing through the
                  origin of all the characters in the string.
 
<b>lfOrientation     Specifies the angle, </b>counterclockwise from the x-axis in
                  tenths of a degree, of the baseline of the character.
 
<b>lfWeight</b>          Specifies the weight of the font ranging from 1 to 1000,
                  with 400 being the value for the standard font. If this
                  member is zero, the driver should choose a reasonable
                  weight.
 
<b>lfItalic</b>          Specifies whether the font is to be italic. If the low bit
                  is set, the font is to be italic. All other bits must be
                  zero.
 
<b>lfUnderline</b>       Specifies whether the font is to be underlined. If the low
                  bit is set, the font is to be underlined. All other bits
                  must be zero.
 
<b>lfStrikeOut</b>       Specifies whether the font is to be struck out. If the low
                  bit is set, the font is to be struck out. All other bits
                  must be zero.
 
<b>lfCharSet</b>         Specifies the character set to be used. It can be one of
                  the following values.
 
                  Value                  Meaning
                  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                  ANSI_CHARSET (0x00)    Indicates the ANSI character set.
 
                  SYMBOL_CHARSET (0x02)  Indicates the Symbol character
                                         set.
 
                  OEM_CHARSET (0xFF)     Indicates an OEM-specific character
                                         set. The characters and
                                         corresponding character codes
                                         depend on the computer.
 
<b>lfOutPrecision</b>    Specifies the required output precision for text. This
                  member can have one of the following values.
 
                  Value                        Meaning
                  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                  OUT_DEFAULT_PRECIS (0x00)    Chooses a reasonable font.
 
                  OUT_STRING_PRECIS (0x01)     Chooses the font whose size
                                               (height and width) most
                                               closely matches the requested
                                               size. The driver may
                                               disregard the requested
                                               orientation and escapement,
                                               but other attributes must
                                               match.
 
                  OUT_CHARACTER_PRECIS (0x02)  Chooses the font whose size
                                               (height and width) most
                                               closely matches the requested
                                               size. The driver may
                                               disregard the requested
                                               orientation, but other
                                               attributes must match.
 
                  OUT_STROKE_PRECIS (0x03)     Chooses a font whose
                                               attributes exactly match the
                                               requested attributes.
 
<b>lfClipPrecision</b>   Specifies the required clipping precision for text. This
                  member can be one of the following values.
 
                  Value                         Meaning
                  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                  CLIP_DEFAULT_PRECIS (0x00)    Chooses a reasonable font.
 
                  CLIP_CHARACTER_PRECIS (0x01)  Chooses a font that allows
                                                clipping of individual
                                                characters. The driver must
                                                be able to clip a character
                                                if any portion of it lies
                                                outside the clipping
                                                rectangle.
 
                  CLIP_STROKE_PRECIS (0x02)     Chooses a font that allows
                                                clipping of portions of a
                                                character. The driver must
                                                be able to clip any portion
                                                of a character that lies
                                                outside the clipping
                                                rectangle.
 
<b>lfQuality</b>         Specifies the required quality for text. This member can
                  have one of the following values.
 
                  Value                   Meaning
                  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                  DEFAULT_QUALITY (0x00)  Chooses a reasonable font.
 
                  DRAFT_QUALITY (0x01)    Chooses a font that generates the
                                          most efficient, speediest output.
                                          The driver can sacrifice
                                          appearance if a speedier font has
                                          lower quality. GDI synthesizes
                                          bold, italic, underline, and
                                          strikethrough characters if
                                          needed.
 
                  PROOF_QUALITY (0x02)    Chooses a font that generates the
                                          highest-quality output. The driver
                                          should sacrifice speedy output if
                                          a slower font has higher quality.
                                          The driver should sacrifice output
                                          precision if a font that does not
                                          exactly match the requested
                                          attributes (such as size) is a
                                          higher quality. GDI synthesizes
                                          bold, italic, underline, and
                                          strikethrough characters if
                                          needed.
 
<b>lfPitchAndFamily</b>  Specifies the font pitch and font family. This member is a
                  combination of one pitch and one family value. The pitch
                  value can be any one of the following values.
 
                  Value                  Meaning
                  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                  DEFAULT_PITCH (0x00)   Chooses a reasonable font.
 
                  FIXED_PITCH (0x01)     Chooses a fixed-pitch font.
 
                  VARIABLE_PITCH (0x02)  Chooses a variable-pitch font.
 
                  The font family, which describes in a general way the look
                  of a font, can be any one of the following values.
 
                  Value                 Meaning
                  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                  FF_DONTCARE (0x00)    Chooses a reasonable font.
 
                  FF_ROMAN (0x10)       Chooses a variable-pitch font with
                                        serifs.
 
                  FF_SWISS (0x20)       Chooses a variable-pitch fonts
                                        without serifs.
 
                  FF_MODERN (0x30)      Chooses a fixed-pitch font.
 
                  FF_SCRIPT (0x40)      Chooses a cursive or script font.
 
                  FF_DECORATIVE (0x50)  Chooses a novelty font.
 
<b>lfFaceName</b>        Specifies a null-terminated string specifying the name of
                  the font. The driver should choose a font having the given
                  name. If the string is empty (the first byte is zero), the
                  driver should choose a reasonable font. The string,
                  including the null terminator, does not exceed 32 bytes.

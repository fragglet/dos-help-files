    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

The network driver (as well as Windows and non-Windows applications) may
require network support software to actually carry out network requests. In
many cases, a network driver carries out a request by calling corresponding
functions in MS-DOS, the NetBIOS, or in real-mode network device drivers or
terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs. Since the network driver runs in
protected mode, extra measures are required to call this real-mode software.
Furthermore, since Windows can switch between applications while network
requests are being processed, measures are required to prevent loss and
corruption of data as a result of a switch.
 
The following sections describe network support in standard- and 386
enhanced-mode Windows.

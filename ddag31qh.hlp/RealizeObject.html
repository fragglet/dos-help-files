The RealizeObject function creates or deletes a physical object. The
function creates a physical object by filling a structure provided by GDI
with device-specific data that corresponds to the attributes of a given
logical pen, brush, bitmap, or font; it deletes the physical object by
removing any memory or resources it allocated when creating the object. GDI
may call this function when an application calls functions such as CreateDC
(GDI.53), SelectObject (GDI.45), and DeleteObject (GDI.69).
 
Every graphics driver must export the RealizeObject function.
 
<b>Parameter    Description</b>
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
<i>lpDestDev    Points to a PDEVICE or PBITMAP s</i>tructure specifying the device
             or bitmap to create the physical object for.
 
<i>wStyle</i>       Specifies the type of object to be realized. This parameter can
             be one of the following values.
 
             Value            Meaning
             ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
             OBJ_PEN (1)      Realizes a physical pen.
 
             OBJ_BRUSH (2)    Realizes a physical brush.
 
             OBJ_FONT (3)     Realizes a device font. If the device has no
                              device fonts or cannot realize the requested
                              font, the RealizeObject function returns
                              zero.
 
             OBJ_PBITMAP (5)  Realizes a device bitmap. GDI passes this
                              value only if the RC_DEVBITS value is set in
                              the dpRaster member of the driver's GDIINFO
                              structure.
 
             If the wStyle parameter is negative, the function deletes the
             specified object.
 
<i>lpInObj      Points to a LPEN, LBRUSH, LFONT, or PBITMAP struct</i>ure specified
             by the wStyle parameter. The structure describes the logical
             attributes of the object to be realized.
 
             If wStyle is negative, the lpInObj parameter points to the
             PPEN, PBRUSH, FONTINFO, or PBITMAP structure, specifying the
             physical object to be deleted.
 
<i>lpOutObj</i>     Points to a buffer to receive the realized object, or points to
             the physical object to delete. Its meaning depends on the value
             of the wStyle parameter.
 
             If wStyle is positive, the lpOutObj parameter points to a
             buffer. The function fills the buffer with device-specific data
             that defines a physical object corresponding to the logical
             object pointed to by the lpInBuf parameter. If lpOutObj is
             NULL, the function returns the size (in bytes) of the physical
             object.
 
             If wStyle is negative, lpOutBuf points to the physical object
             to delete. Although GDI frees the memory pointed to by
             lpOutBuf when the function returns, the RealizeObject function
             must free any other memory or resources associated with the
             physical object.
 
<i>lpTextXForm  Points to a TEXTXFORM structure or specifi</i>es a POINT structure
             as specified by the wStyle parameter.
 
             If wStyle is OBJ_BRUSH, the lpTextXForm parameter is a POINT
             structure containing the x- and y-coordinates (relative to an
             8-bit boundary) on which to align the start of the brush's
             pattern.
 
             If wStyle is OBJ_FONT, lpTextXForm points to a TEXTXFORM
             structure containing information about the appearance of a
             realized font. Both the realized font and the contents of the
             TEXTXFORM structure are later passed to the ExtTextOut
             function, allowing more capable devices to make changes to the
             standard font.
 
<b>Return Value</b>
 
The return value is the size, in bytes, of the physical object, if
successful. Otherwise, it returns zero if it cannot realize the object.
 
If wStyle is OBJ_PBITMAP, the return value can be zero to direct GDI to
create a main memory bitmap instead of a device bitmap. The return value
will be 0x80000000L to indicate an error, and prevent GDI from creating a
main memory bitmap.
 
<b>Comments</b>
 
The export ordinal for this function is 10.
 
GDI manages the physical object and makes the object available to the the
device driver as needed to draw output. When GDI no longer needs the object,
it directs RealizeObject to delete the object.
 
To create an object, GDI calls this function twice. It first requests the
size in bytes of the physical object, then it allocates space for the object
and calls RealizeObject again passing a pointer to the allocated space. The
<i>lpOutObj</i> parameter specifies which action to take. If it is NULL, the
function returns the size; if it is not NULL, the function fills the
corresponding structure.
 
The format and content of a physical object depends entirely on the device
driver. For pens and brushes, the recommended formats are the PPEN and
<b>PBRUSH structures.</b> For fonts, the structure must contain the dfType through
<b>dfFace members of the FONTINFO structure, </b>and dfDevice and dfFace must have
valid pointers to device and font strings.
 
When realizing pens, GDI may request a width or styled line even though the
driver does not support such pens. (The dpCurves and dpLines members in the
driver's GDIINFO structure specify whether the driver supports wide and
styled lines.) In such cases, the RealizeObject function should create a
nominal pen, that is, a physical pen that is solid and one-pixel wide. GDI
uses this nominal pen to carry out its own styling and wide-line
operations.
 
When realizing brushes, RealizeObject sets the foreground and background
colors for hatch and solid brushes, but not for patterned brushes if the
patterned brush uses a monochrome bitmap. For these patterned brushes, GDI
provides a DRAWMODE structure that specifies the foreground and background
colors for the brush. If the color specified for a solid brush does not
exactly match a physical color, the function can create a dithered color for
the brush. The function realizes hollow brushes. When a hollow brush is
passed to a drawing routine, the driver does no filling at all.
 
If the lpTextXForm parameter specifies a POINT structure, it represents the
physical object's pattern reference point. This reference point specifies
where to start a patterned brush (relative to a 8-bit boundary) so that the
brush pattern aligns with areas previously filled using the brush. The
parameter contains values, in the range 0 to 7, that specify on which bits
to start the pattern.
 
Display drivers generally do not realize fonts. Instead, they require GDI to
realize the fonts to be used with the display. In this case, the display
driver's RealizeObject must returns zero whenever wStyle is OBJ_FONT.
 
When realizing bitmaps, RealizeObject must create a device bitmap, storing
the bitmap bits in device memory (such as RAM on the device adapter) rather
than main memory. When GDI requests the size of the physical bitmap, the
function must include space for at least a PBITMAP structure, but any
additional space is up to the driver. Although no space for the bitmap bits
is required, RealizeObject must include some value to indicate the location
of the bitmap bits in device memory. GDI intercepts all requests to create
monochrome bitmaps. This means RealizeObject is never called to create a
monochrome device bitmap.

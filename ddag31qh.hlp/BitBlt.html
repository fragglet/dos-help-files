The BitBlt function transfers bits from a rectangle to a source device to a
rectangle having the same dimensions to a destination device. The transfer
is controlled by a ternary raster operation value that specifies how
corresponding bits from the source, destination, and pattern in a brush are
combined to form the final bits in the destination.
 
A graphics driver must export the BitBlt function if the RC_BITBLT value is
set in the dpRaster member of the driver's GDIINFO structure.
 
<b>Parameter   Description</b>
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
<i>lpDestDev   Points to PDEVICE or PBITMAP stru</i>cture specifying the
            destination device or bitmap.
 
<i>wDestX      Specif</i>ies the x-coordinate (in device units) of the origin of
            the rectangle on the destination device to receive the
            transferred bits.
 
<i>wDestY      Specif</i>ies the y-coordinate (in device units) of the origin of
            the rectangle on the destination device to receive the
            transferred bits.
 
<i>lpSrcDev    Points to PDEVICE or PBITMAP</i> structure specifying the source
            device or bitmap.
 
<i>wSrcX       Spe</i>cifies the x-coordinate (in device units) of the origin of
            the rectangle on the source device containing the bits to
            transfer.
 
<i>wSrcY       Spe</i>cifies the y-coordinate (in device units) of the origin of
            the rectangle on the source device containing the bits to
            transfer.
 
<i>wXext</i>       Specifies the width (in device units) of the rectangles on both
            the source and destination devices.
 
<i>wYext</i>       Specifies the height (in device units) of the rectangle on both
            the source and destination devices.
 
<i>Rop3</i>        Specifies a ternary raster-operation value. This value
            determines how BitBlt combines corresponding pixels from the
            source, destination, and brush to produce the final pixels in
            the destination rectangle. The Rop3 parameter can be any one of
            256 ternary raster-operation values; the following lists the
            most common values.

<i>lpPBrush    Points to a </i>PBRUSH structure specifying a physical brush.
            BitBlt uses this brush only if the Rop3 parameter specifies a
            ternary-raster operation that requires the brush to be combined
            with source or destination or both.
 
<i>lpDrawMode  Points to a DRAWMO</i>DE structure specifying the color information
            BitBlt needs to determine patterned brush colors and to carry
            color conversions and transparent copy operations.
 
<b>Return Value</b>
 
This return value is TRUE if it is successful. Otherwise, it is FALSE.
 
<b>Comments</b>
 
The export ordinal for this function is 1.
 
The lpDestDev and lpSrcDev parameters can specify the same device, and
transferring bits from one part of a device to another is a valid operation.
If the source and destination rectangle overlap, BitBlt must carefully
transfer bits so that the transfer does not inadvertently overwrite source
bits before they have been transferred to the destination.
 
The Rop3 parameter specifies whether bits from the source, destination, and
brush are used in the transfer. If the ternary raster operation specified by
<i>Rop3 does no</i>t include the source, BitBlt ignores the source bits. If the
operation does not include the destination, BitBlt replaces the original
destination bits without using them to form the final bits.
 
If Rop3 does not include the brush, BitBlt ignores the brush. If Rop3 does
include the brush, BitBlt must determine whether the brush is solid or
patterned (that is, has an associated bitmap). If the brush has a bitmap,
<b>BitBlt</b> must combine the corresponding bits of the bitmap with the source and
destination bits (as specified by the raster operation) to form the final
destination bits.
 
If the source and bitmap associated with the brush do not have the same
color format as the destination, BitBlt must convert the source and brush
bitmap to the destination's color format before transferring bits. BitBlt
uses the text (foreground) and background colors specified by the
<i>lpDrawMode</i> parameter to convert colors.
 
To convert a monochrome bitmap to a color bitmap, BitBlt converts white bits
(1) to the background color and converts black bits (0) to the text
(foreground) color.
 
To convert a color bitmap to a monochrome bitmap, BitBlt converts all pixels
that match the background color to white (1), and converts all other pixels
to black (0).
 
In some device drivers, BitBlt must check the bkMode member of the DRAWMODE
structure pointed to by the lpDrawMode parameter as well as the Rop3
parameter to determine how to carry out the transfer. If the bkMode member
specifies the background mode TRANSPARENT1, BitBlt must not transfer source
and brush bits that have the same color as the destination's background
color (as specified by the bkColor member of the DRAWMODE structure pointed
to by lpDrawMode). In other words, the corresponding destination bits must
be left unchanged. Other background modes do not affect the transfer. Only
device drivers that have set the C1_TRANSPARENT value in the dpCaps1 member
of the GDIINFO structure are required to check the background mode.

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>  Use the Set Breakpoint command to stop execution at a
  certain point in your code and return control to you.
  The shortcut key is F9. When you choose Set Breakpoint,
  a box pops up that gives you several options for
  inserting breakpoints into a source window:
 
    ■ Break at Location creates a breakpoint either at the
      line the cursor is on or with the line set in the
      Location text box.
    ■ Break at Location if Expression is true will break
      on a specified line only if the expression entered
      in the Expression text box is true.
    ■ Break when Expression is true will break on the
      source line that causes the expression in the
      Expression text box to be true.
 
  To set a breakpoint by line number, you should use the
  Location text box. Type a file path and line number,
  for example, C:\QPASCAL\ERRHDL.PAS(458); then select
  &lt; OK &gt;.
 
  To set a breakpoint by expression, you should use the
  Expression text box. Enter a variable and an
  expression that will return a Boolean value (for
  example, the_amount = 76), then select &lt; OK &gt;.
 
  Once you set a breakpoint and run the program, execution
  will pause immediately before the specified line. You
  can then
 
    ■ Press F8 to trace into a procedure or function
    ■ Press F10 to step over a procedure or function
      to the next statement
 
  To remove or change a breakpoint, you can use the
  Edit Breakpoints command in this menu.

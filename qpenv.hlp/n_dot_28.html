    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<div class="page-title"> Cannot save configuration</div>
<pre>  An attempt to save the changes in the Options dialog box
  failed because QuickPascal could not save the QP.INI
  file. Make sure that the Environment dialog box under
  the Options menu shows the path where QuickPascal is
  located.
 
  If you are saving to a floppy disk, check that the disk
  is not write-protected and that the disk door is closed.
  Also check that the disk has enough space available to
  save the QP.INI file, and that an existing QP.INI file
  is not read-only. If none of these solves the problem,
  make sure your disk drive is working properly.

Use Copy (or press Ctrl+Ins) to copy selected text to the
Clipboard. The original text is unchanged.
 
You can then use Paste (Shift+Ins) to insert the text
at a new position. You can also open a new or existing
document and insert the text.
 
Tip: To select text, place the cursor at the beginning
     of the text and press the Shift+direction keys.
 
The text is still on the Clipboard and can be pasted again.
Each time you cut or copy a piece of text, the new text
replaces any text on the Clipboard.

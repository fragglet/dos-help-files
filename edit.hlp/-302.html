Use Cut (or press Shift+Del) to remove selected text and
put it on the Clipboard, a temporary holding area.
 
You can then use Paste (Shift+Ins) to insert the text at
a new position. You can also open a new or existing
document and insert the text.
 
The text is still on the Clipboard and can be pasted again.
Each time you cut or copy a piece of text, the new text
replaces any text on the Clipboard.
 
Tip: To select text, place the cursor at the beginning
     of the text and press the Shift+direction keys.
     To remove selected text without copying it to the
     Clipboard, press Del.

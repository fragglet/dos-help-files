<pre>More memory was required than is available. To correct this:
  ■ Exit and reduce the number of your DOS buffers (BUFFERS=)
    in your CONFIG.SYS file. Then reboot your computer.
  ■ Exit and reduce the number of memory-resident programs.
  ■ Exit and reduce the number of loaded device drivers.
    Then reboot your computer.

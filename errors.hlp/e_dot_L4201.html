     ILINK warning L4201
 
     fix-up frame relative to an (as yet) undefined symbol - assuming
     ok
 
     A reference was made relative to a segment that is different from
     the target segment of the reference.
 
     This error occurs in either of the following situations:
 
        ■ A frame-relative fix-up.
 
          For example, if _id1 is defined in segment _TEXT, the
          instruction call DGROUP:_id1 produces this warning. The frame
          DGROUP is ignored, so the linker treats the call as if it
          were call _TEXT:_id1.
 
        ■ A frame-relative absolute fix-up.
 
          Both segments are absolute (defined with AT). The linker
          treats the executable file as if the file were to run in real
          mode only.

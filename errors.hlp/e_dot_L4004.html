     LINK warning L4004
 
     possible fix-up overflow at 'offset' in segment 'segment'
 
     A near call/jump was made to another segment which was not a
     member of the same group as the segment from which the call/jump
     was made.
 
     This call/jump can cause an incorrect address calculation when
     the distance between the paragraph address (frame number) of the
     segment group and the target segment is greater than 64K, even
     when the distance between the segment where the call/jump was
     actually made and the target segment is less than 64K.
                                    -♦-

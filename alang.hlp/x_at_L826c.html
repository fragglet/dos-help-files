     The buffer used by this function has the following format:
 
     Byte     Contents
 
     0        Maximum number of characters to read, set by program
     1        Number of characters actually read (excluding carriage
              return), set by MS-DOS
     2+       String read from keyboard or standard input, terminated
              by a carriage return (0Dh)
 
     If the buffer fills to one fewer than the maximum number of
     characters it can hold, subsequent input is ignored and the bell
     is sounded until a carriage return is detected.
 
     This input function is buffered with type-ahead capability, and
     all of the standard keyboard editing commands are active.
 
     If the standard input is not redirected, BREAK is OFF, and CTRL+C
     is detected at the console, an Int 23h is not executed.
 
     See Int 21h Functions 01h, 06h, 07h, and 08h for single-character
     input from the keyboard or standard input device.
 
     You can also read strings from the keyboard by performing a read
     (Int 21h Function 3Fh) using either the predefined handle for the
     standard input (0000h) if it has not been redirected or a handle
     obtained by opening the logical device CON.

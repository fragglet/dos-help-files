     The function fails if
 
        ■ Any element of the specified path does not exist.
        ■ A file with the identical path name (the same filename
          and extension in the same location in the directory
          structure) already exists.
        ■ The file is being created in the root directory and the root
          directory is full.
        ■ [Version 3.0+] The program is running on a network and the
          user has insufficient access rights to the directory that
          will contain the file.
 
     The file is usually given the normal attribute (0) when it is
     created, and is opened for both read and write operations. The
     attribute can subsequently be modified with Int 21h Function 43h.
 
     See also Int 21h Functions 3Ch, 5Ah, and 6Ch, which provide
     alternative ways of creating files.
 
     This function may be used to implement semaphores in a network or
     multitasking environment. If the function succeeds, the program
     has acquired the semaphore. To release the semaphore, the program
     simply deletes the file.

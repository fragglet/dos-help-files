     The special ASCII codes for bell (07h), backspace (08h), carriage
     return (0Dh), and line feed (0Ah) are recognized, and the
     appropriate action is taken. All other characters are written to
     the display (even if they are control characters), and the cursor
     is moved to the next position.
 
     In video modes that support multiple pages, characters can be
     written to any page, regardless of the page currently being
     displayed.
 
     Line wrapping and scrolling are provided. If the cursor is at the
     end of a line, it is moved to the beginning of the next line. If
     the cursor reaches the end of the last line on the screen, the
     screen is scrolled up by one line and the cursor is placed at the
     beginning of a new blank line. The attribute for the entire new
     line is taken from the last character that was written on the
     preceding line.
 
     The default MS-DOS console driver (CON) uses this function to
     write text to the screen. You cannot use this function to specify
     the attribute of a character. One method of writing a character to
     the screen with a specific attribute is to first write an ASCII
     blank (20h) with the desired attribute at the current cursor
     location using Int 10h Function 09h, then write the actual
     character with Int 10h Function 0Eh. This technique, although
     somewhat clumsy, does not require the program to explicitly handle
     line wrapping and scrolling.

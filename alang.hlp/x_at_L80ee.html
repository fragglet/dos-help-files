     On fixed disks, the upper 2 bits of the 10-bit cylinder number are
     placed in the upper 2 bits of register CL.
 
     On fixed disks, error code 11h indicates that a read error
     occurred that was corrected by the ECC algorithm; in this event,
     register AL contains the burst length. The data returned is
     probably good, although there is a small chance that the data was
     not corrected properly. If a multisector transfer was requested,
     the operation was terminated after the sector containing the read
     error.
 
     On floppy disk drives, an error may result from the drive motor
     being off at the time of the request. The ROM BIOS does not
     automatically wait for the drive to come up to speed before
     attempting the read operation. The requesting program should reset
     the floppy disk system (Int 13h Function 00h) and retry the
     operation three times before assuming that the error results from
     some other cause.

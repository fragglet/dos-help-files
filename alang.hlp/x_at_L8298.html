     The records are read into memory at the current disk transfer area
     address, specified by the most recent call to Int 21h Function
     1Ah. It is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that this
     area is large enough for the group of records that will be
     transferred. If the size and location of the buffer are such that
     a segment overflow or wraparound would occur, the function fails
     with a return code of 02h.
 
     The file location of the data to be read is determined by the
     combination of the relative-record field (offset 21h) and the
     record size field (offset 0Eh) of the FCB. The default record size
     is 128 bytes.
 
     After the disk transfer is performed, the current block (offset
     0Ch), current record (offset 020h), and relative-record (offset
     21h) fields of the FCB are updated to point to the next record in
     the file.
 
     If a partial record is read at end-of-file, the remainder of
     the record is padded with zeros.
 
     Compare with Int 21h Function 21h, which transfers only one record
     per function call and does not update the FCB relative-record
     field.
 
     [Version 3.0+]
     If the program is running on a network, the user must have Read
     access rights to the directory containing the file to be read.

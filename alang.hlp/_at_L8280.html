     The record is written (logically, not necessarily physically) to
     the disk from memory at the current disk transfer area (DTA)
     address, specified by the most recent call to Int 21h Function
     1Ah. If the size of the record and the location of the buffer are
     such that a segment overflow or wraparound would occur, the
     function fails with a return code of 02h.
 
     The number of bytes of data to be written is specified by the
     record size field (offset 0Eh) of the file control block (FCB).
 
     The file location of the data that will be written is specified by
     the combination of the current block field (offset 0Ch) and
     current record field (offset 20h) of the file control block (FCB).
     These fields are also automatically incremented by this function.
 
     [Version 3.0+]
     If the program is running on a network, the user must have Write
     access rights to the directory containing the file to be written.

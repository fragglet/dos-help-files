  Interrupt:   22h
 
  Title:       Terminate Handler Address
 
  See also:    <a href='psp.html'>Program Segment Prefix Chart</a>
 
  Description:
 
     The machine interrupt vector for Int 22h (memory locations
     0000:0088h through 0000:008Bh) contains the address of the routine
     that receives control when the currently executing program
     terminates via Int 20h, Int 27h, or Int 21h Functions 00h, 31h, or
     4Ch. The address in this vector is also copied into offsets 0Ah
     through 0Dh of the program segment prefix (PSP) when a program is
     loaded but before it begins executing, and is restored from the
     PSP (in case it was modified by the application) as part of
     MS-DOS's termination handling.
 
     This interrupt should never be issued directly.

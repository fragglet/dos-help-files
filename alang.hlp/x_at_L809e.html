    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

     In graphics modes, the replication factor in CX produces a valid
     result only for the current row. If more characters are written
     than there are remaining columns in the current row, the result is
     unpredictable.
 
     All values of AL result in some sort of display; control
     characters, including bell, backspace, carriage return, and line
     feed, are not recognized as special characters and do not affect
     the cursor position.
 
     After a character is written, the cursor must be moved explicitly
     with Int 10h Function 02h to the next position.
 
     To write a character without changing the attribute at the current
     cursor position, use Int 10h Function 0Ah.
 
     If this function is used to write characters in graphics mode and
     bit 7 of BL is set, the character will be exclusive-OR'd (XOR)
     with the current display contents. This feature can be used to
     write characters and then erase them.
 
     For the CGA and PCjr in graphics modes 04h-06h, the bit patterns
     for character codes 80h-FFh are obtained from a table whose
     address is stored in the vector for Int 1Fh. On the PCjr, the
     address of the table for character codes 00-7Fh is stored in the
     vector for Int 44h. Alternative character sets can be installed by
     loading them into memory and updating this vector.
 
     For the EGA, MCGA, and VGA in graphics modes, the address of the
     character definition table is stored in the vector for Int 43h.

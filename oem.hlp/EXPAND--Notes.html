<b>Retrieving files from the Setup disks</b>
 
Most of the files on the Setup disks provided with MS-DOS 6.22 are
compressed. Each of these compressed files has a file extension that ends
with an underscore character (_). When you installed MS-DOS, you ran the
Setup program, which expanded these files before copying them to your
system. However, if you need to retrieve just one or a few files from the
original disks, you can use the EXPAND command.
 
<b>Letting EXPAND prompt you</b>
 
If you don't include the destination, or don't include the compressed file
and the destination, EXPAND prompts you for the information and provides
examples.

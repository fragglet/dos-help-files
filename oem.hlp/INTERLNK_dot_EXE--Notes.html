                            INTERLNK.EXE──Notes
 
<b>Specifying the number of drives</b>
 
When specifying the number of redirected drives in the /DRIVES switch, make
sure the &lt;<a href='LASTDRIVE.html'>LASTDRIVE</a>&gt; command in your CONFIG.SYS file is set high enough to
accomodate that number of redirected drives.
 
<b>Loading into the upper memory area</b>
 
By default, the Interlnk device driver is loaded into the upper memory area,
if MS-DOS UMB support is enabled and memory is available. To load the device
driver in conventional memory, use the /LOW switch.
 
<b>Position of the Interlnk command in the CONFIG.SYS file</b>
 
The position of the DEVICE command that loads INTERLNK.EXE can affect
pre-existing drive assignments. For example, suppose your computer includes
a floppy disk drive (A), two hard disk drives (C and D), and two RAM drives
(E and F). If you load the INTERLNK.EXE device driver before installing the
RAM drives, and you choose to redirect three drives, Interlnk will assign
letters E, F, and G to the redirected drives and letters H and I to the RAM
drives. To prevent this from happening, load INTERLNK.EXE last in your
CONFIG.SYS file.
 
<b>Saving memory</b>
 
By default, the Interlnk device driver loads all its code into memory. You
can save memory by specifying the /NOPRINTER, /LPT, or /COM switch. If you
specify the /NOPRINTER switch, the Interlnk program does not load code that
redirects printers. If you specify the /LPT switch without the /COM switch,
the program does not load code that supports serial ports. If you specify
the /COM switch without the /LPT switch, the program does not load code that
supports parallel ports.
 
<b>Using a serial mouse with Microsoft Windows</b>
 
If you are using a serial mouse with Microsoft Windows, specify either the
/LPT switch or a /COM switch that designates a COM port other than the one
the mouse is using. For example, if the serial mouse uses COM1, and you are
using a parallel connection, specify the /LPT switch to prevent Interlnk
from scanning all COM ports.
 
<b>Redirecting LPT1 or LPT2 and printing from Microsoft Windows</b>
 
If you redirect LPT1 or LPT2 and print from Microsoft Windows, use Control
Panel to assign the printer to either LPT1.DOS or LPT2.DOS.
 
<b>Version of MS-DOS</b>
 
Some features of MS-DOS may not be available to the client computer if you
are running a different DOS version on your Interlnk server. For example, if
you have large partitions on your Interlnk server and are running MS-DOS 3.0
on your client, the partitions will not be available to the client because
MS-DOS 3.0 does not support them.
 
<b>Running an application located on the server</b>
 
If you use the Interlnk program to run an application located on the server,
make sure the application is configured for the computer you have designated
as the Interlnk client.
 
<b>Limitations on using INTERLNK with other commands</b>
 
The following commands do not work with the INTERLNK.EXE device driver:
 
    CHKDSK         FORMAT
 
    DEFRAG         MIRROR
 
    DISKCOMP       SYS
 
    DISKCOPY       UNDELETE
 
    FDISK          UNFORMAT
 
                                      ♦

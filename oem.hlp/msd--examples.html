    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<b>Starting the MSD program</b>
 
If you wanted to examine some of the technical information about your
computer before calling Microsoft Product Support Services, you would start
the MSD program by typing the following at the command prompt:
 
    msd
 
The MSD program has an interface that makes it easy for you to access
detailed technical information about your computer.
 
<b>Creating a report</b>
 
Before calling Microsoft Product Support Services, you could create a file
called COMPUTER.TXT that contains a detailed technical report about your
computer. To do this, you could type the following at the command prompt:
 
    msd /p computer.txt
 
The COMPUTER.TXT file would contain the information about your computer.
 
If you want MSD to create a detailed report about your computer and you
wanted the report to include such information as your name, company,
address, and phone number, you would type the following at the command
prompt:
 
    msd /f computer.txt
 
The MSD program will prompt you for the information.

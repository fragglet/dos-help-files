<b>Checking restored files</b>
 
Once a file has been restored, you can use the DIR or TYPE command to make
sure the file was restored properly.
 
<b>Limitations on RESTORE</b>
 
You cannot use the RESTORE command to restore system files (IO.SYS and
MSDOS.SYS). RESTORE does not work with drives that have been redirected with
the ASSIGN or JOIN command.
 
<b>Compatibility with previous versions of BACKUP</b>
 
The MS-DOS 6.22 RESTORE command can restore files that were backed up by
using the BACKUP command in MS-DOS versions 2.0 through 5.0.
 
<b>RESTORE exit codes</b>
 
The following list shows each exit code and a brief description of its
meaning:
 
0
    RESTORE successfully restored the file or files.
 
1
    RESTORE could not find the files to restore.
 
3
    The user pressed CTRL+C to stop the restoring operation.
 
4
    RESTORE stopped because of an error.
 
You can use the ERRORLEVEL parameter on the IF command line in a batch
program to process exit codes returned by RESTORE.
 
For an example of a batch program that processes exit codes, see the &lt;<a href='IF--Example.html'>IF</a>&gt;
command or the &lt;<a href='Choice.html'>CHOICE</a>&gt;command.
 
<b>Listing the names of backed-up files</b>
 
Use the /D switch to see a list of the backed up files. If you specify
filename with the /D switch, RESTORE displays a list of the backed up files
that match the name you specify. If you use the /D switch, RESTORE does not
restore any files.
 
<b>Restoring to different drives</b>
 
While you must restore files to their original directory, you can restore
them to a different drive. For example, files backed up from the
C:\MYFILES\*.* directory can be restored to the D:\MYFILES\*.* directory.

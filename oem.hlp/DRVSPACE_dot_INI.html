                             DRVSPACE.INI File
 
The DRVSPACE.INI file is a text file with the System, Read-Only, and Hidden
attributes. DriveSpace stores this file in the root directory of your
startup drive. The DRVSPACE.INI file contains variables that DriveSpace uses
when your computer starts.
 
<b>Note:</b>  Although it is possible to change these variables yourself (by using
       the &lt;<a href='DRVSPACE.html'>DRVSPACE</a>&gt; command or by editing the file directly), you should
       do so only if you understand what they do and what the results might
       be. Before changing the DRVSPACE.INI file, you should make a backup
       copy of the file. For changes to the DRVSPACE.INI settings to take
       effect, you must restart your computer.
 
The DRVSPACE.INI file can contain one or more of the following variables:
 
AUTOMOUNT=0|1|A...Z
 
    Enables or disables the automatic mounting of removable drives,
    including floppy disk drives. By default, DriveSpace automatically
    mounts all removable drives. To change this setting, use the
    &lt;<a href='AUTOMOUNTING.html'>DRVSPACE /AUTOMOUNT</a>&gt; command.
 
DOUBLEGUARD=0|1
 
    The DOUBLEGUARD setting enables or disables DoubleGuard(tm) safety
    checking. When DoubleGuard is enabled, DriveSpace will constantly check
    its memory for damage by some other program. By default, DoubleGuard is
    enabled. To change this setting, use the &lt;<a href='DRVGUARD.html'>DRVSPACE /DOUBLEGUARD</a>&gt;
    command.
 
LASTDRIVE=drive
 
    The LASTDRIVE setting specifies the highest drive letter available for
    use by DriveSpace. To change this setting, use the
    &lt;<a href='DRVSPACE__sl_LASTDRIVE.html'>DRVSPACE /LASTDRIVE</a>&gt; command.
 
MAXFILEFRAGMENTS=n
 
    The MAXFILEFRAGMENTS setting sets the limit for the amount of
    fragmentation allowed for all mounted compressed volume files. To change
    this setting, use the &lt;<a href='DRVSPACE__sl_MAXFILEFRAGMENTS.html'>DRVSPACE /MAXFILEFRAGMENTS</a>&gt; command.
 
    The MAXREMOVABLEDRIVES setting specifies how many additional drives
    DriveSpace should allocate memory for when your computer starts. This
    determines how many additional compressed drives you can create,
    compress, or mount without restarting your computer. To change this
    setting, use the &lt;<a href='DRVSPACE__sl_MAXREMOVABLEDRIVES.html'>DRVSPACE /MAXREMOVABLEDRIVES</a>&gt; command.
 
ROMSERVER=0|1
    Enables or disables the check for a ROM BIOS Microsoft Real-time
    Compresson Interface (MRCI) server. By default, the ROM MRCI check is
    disabled. To change this setting, use the &lt;<a href='DRVSPACE__sl_ROMSERVER.html'>DRVSPACE /ROMSERVER</a>&gt;
    command.
 
SWITCHES=/F|/N|/FN
 
    Controls the way the CTRL+F5 and CTRL+F8 keys work. (Normally, you can
    press CTRL+F5 or CTRL+F8 to bypass DriveSpace when your computer
    starts.) To change this setting, use the &lt;<a href='DRVSPACE__sl_SWITCHES.html'>DRVSPACE /SWITCHES</a>&gt; command.
    (To remove SWITCHES settings from your DRVSPACE.INI file, you must edit
    the file directly.)
 
ActivateDrive=x,yn
    This setting specifies that DriveSpace should mount a compressed volume
    file when your computer starts. The DRVSPACE.INI file can contain more
    than one ActivateDrive setting. Except for the host drive letter, which
    you can change by using the &lt;<a href='DRVSPACE__sl_HOST.html'>DRVSPACE /HOST</a>&gt; command, do not change the
    ActivateDrive setting yourself.
 
    The ActivateDrive setting requires the following parameters:
 
    x
        The drive letter to assign to the newly mounted compressed drive.
 
    y
        The drive letter of the host drive. To change the host drive letter,
        use the &lt;<a href='DRVSPACE__sl_HOST.html'>DRVSPACE /HOST</a>&gt; command.
 
    n
        The number of the compressed volume file (CVF). To determine the CVF
        number, examine its filename extension. If the CVF filename is
        DRVSPACE.000, set n to 0; if the CVF filename is DRVSPACE.001, set n
        to 1, and so on.
 
FIRSTDRIVE=x
 
    Set by DriveSpace each time it modifies the DRVSPACE.INI file.
    DriveSpace uses this setting to control the overall assignment of drive
    letters. Do not change this setting yourself.

                                  MEMMAKER
 
Starts the MemMaker program, which optimizes your computer's memory by
moving device drivers and memory-resident programs to upper memory. To use
MemMaker, your computer must have an 80386 or 80486 processor and extended
memory. For more information about running MemMaker, see the chapter "Making
More Memory Available" in the MS-DOS User's Guide.
 
Do not use this command while Windows is running.
 
<b>Syntax</b>
 
    MEMMAKER [/B] [/BATCH] [/SESSION] [/SWAP:drive] [/T] [/UNDO] [/W:n,m]
 
<b>Switches</b>
 
/B
    Displays MemMaker in black and white. Use this option if MemMaker isn't
    displayed correctly on a monochrome monitor.
 
/BATCH
    Runs MemMaker in batch (unattended) mode. In batch mode, MemMaker takes
    the default action at all prompts. If an error occurs, MemMaker restores
    your previous CONFIG.SYS, AUTOEXEC.BAT and (if necessary) Windows
    SYSTEM.INI files. After MemMaker has completed, you can review status
    messages by viewing the contents of the MEMMAKER.STS file. (To view this
    file, use a text editor such as MS-DOS Editor, or use the TYPE
    command.)
 
/SESSION
    Used exclusively by MemMaker during the optimization process.
 
/SWAP:drive
    Specifies the letter of the drive that was originally your startup disk
    drive. Specify the current drive letter after the colon. This switch is
    necessary only if the drive letter of your startup disk drive has
    changed since your computer started. (The drive letter sometimes changes
    because of disk swapping performed by some disk-compression programs.)
    If the drive letter of your startup drive has changed and you do not
    specify this switch, MemMaker will be unable to find your system startup
    files.
 
    You do not need to use this switch if you are using Stacker 2.0,
    SuperStor, or Microsoft DoubleSpace.
 
/T
    Disables the detection of IBM Token-Ring networks. Use this switch if
    your computer includes such a network and you are having problems
    running MemMaker.
 
/UNDO
    Instructs MemMaker to undo its most recent changes. When MemMaker
    optimizes your system's memory, it makes changes to your CONFIG.SYS and
    AUTOEXEC.BAT files (and, if necessary, your Windows SYSTEM.INI file). If
    your system doesn't work properly after MemMaker completes, or if you
    are not satisfied with your new memory configuration, you can return to
    your previous configuration by starting MemMaker with the /UNDO switch.
 
/W:size1,size2
    Specifies how much upper-memory space to reserve for Windows translation
    buffers. Windows needs two areas of upper memory for its translation
    buffers. The size1 value specifies the size of the first region; size2
    specifies the size of the second region. By default, MemMaker does not
    reserve upper memory for Windows; this is equivalent to specifying
    /W:0,0.

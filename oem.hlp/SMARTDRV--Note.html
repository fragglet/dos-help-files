<b>Enabling write caching on specific drives</b>
 
By default, MS-DOS Setup configures SMARTDrive so that write-caching is
disabled. This configuration is extremely safe, but does not provide optimum
speed. After SMARTDrive starts, you can use the SMARTDRV command to enable
write caching on specific drives. This can significantly speed up your
system. To enable write-caching on a particular drive, carry out the
SMARTDRV command and specify the drive letter and a plus sign. For example,
to enable write-caching on drive C, you would type the following:
 
    smartdrv c+
 
For information about enabling write-caching for compressed drives, see
"SMARTDrive and Compressed Drives" later in this help topic.
 
<b>Using extended memory</b>
 
For SMARTDrive to use extended memory, your CONFIG.SYS file must contain a
DEVICE command for HIMEM.SYS or another extended-memory manager that
conforms to the Lotus/Intel/Microsoft/AST eXtended Memory Specification
(XMS).
 
<b>Loading SMARTDrive into the upper memory area</b>
 
If the upper memory area is available through MS-DOS, SMARTDrive will
automatically load into upper memory. You do not need to use the LOADHIGH
command with SMARTDrive.
 
If your hard disk requires double buffering, SMARTDrive may run faster if
its cache is located in conventional memory. To load SMARTDrive into upper
memory and its cache in conventional memory, use the following command:
 
    loadhigh smartdrv /l
 
<b>SMARTDrive and compressed drives</b>
 
SMARTDrive does not actually cache compressed drives; instead, it caches the
physical (host) drive on which the compressed volume file is located. This
improves the speed of both the physical drive and the compressed drive.
 
<b>SMARTDrive and CD-ROM drives</b>
 
If you are using a CD-ROM drive and you want to cache it, load MSCDEX before
you load SMARTDrive. If you do not want to cache the CD-ROM drive, load
SMARTDrive with the /U switch. (Note that MS-DOS Setup adds the SMARTDRV
command to the beginning of your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, before any other
commands.)
 
To find out whether SMARTDrive is caching your CD-ROM drive, type SMARTDRV
at the command prompt.

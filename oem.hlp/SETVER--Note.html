<b>SETVER confirmation</b>
 
If you make changes to the version table and no errors are detected, MS-DOS
displays the following message:
 
    WARNING - Contact your software vendor for information about whether a
    specific program works with MS-DOS 6.22. It is possible that Microsoft
    has not verified whether the program will successfully run if you use
    the SETVER command to change the program version number and version
    table. If you run the program after changing the version table, you may
    lose or corrupt data or introduce system instabilities. Microsoft is not
    responsible for any loss or damage, or for lost or corrupted data.
 
    Version table successfully updated
 
    The version change will take effect the next time you restart your
    system.
 
<b>Loading the version table into memory</b>
 
Before you can use the SETVER command, the version table must be loaded into
memory by a &lt;<a href='Device.html'>DEVICE</a>&gt; command in your CONFIG.SYS file. By default, the MS-DOS
Setup program modifies your CONFIG.SYS file to ensure that the version table
is loaded into memory each time you start your system.
 
<b>Setting the version number of a command interpreter</b>
 
You can use SETVER to set the version number of a command interpreter;
however, if you set the version number of the MS-DOS 6.22 command
interpreter (COMMAND.COM), you may not be able to start your system.
 
<b>Using the version table</b>
 
Many programs designed to run with a previous version of MS-DOS will run
correctly with MS-DOS 6.22. In some cases, however, a program might not run
correctly unless its name is included in the version table. The table
indicates to the program that it is running with the MS-DOS version for
which it was designed, even though it is running with MS-DOS 6.22. By
interpreting MS-DOS 6.22 as the earlier version, the program will probably
run correctly; however, using SETVER will not solve the problem if the
program is not compatible with MS-DOS 6.22.
 
<b>Restarting after updating the version table</b>
 
When you update the version table by adding or deleting entries, you must
restart your system before the changes will take effect.
 
<b>Updating existing entries</b>
 
If you specify a filename that is already in the version table, the new
entry replaces the existing entry.
 
<b>SETVER exit codes</b>
 
The following list shows each exit code and a brief description of its
meaning:
 
0
    SETVER successfully completed its task.
 
1
    The user specified an invalid command switch.
 
2
    The user specified an invalid filename.
 
3
    There is insufficient system memory to carry out the command.
 
4
    The user specified an invalid version-number format.
 
5
    SETVER could not find the specified entry in the version table.
 
6
    SETVER could not find the SETVER.EXE file.
 
7
    The user specified an invalid drive.
 
8
    The user specified too many command-line parameters.
 
9
    SETVER detected missing command-line parameters.
 
10
    SETVER detected an error while reading the SETVER.EXE file.
 
11
    The SETVER.EXE file is corrupt.
 
12
    The specified SETVER.EXE file does not support a version table.
 
13
    There is insufficient space in the version table for a new entry.
 
14
    SETVER detected an error while writing to the SETVER.EXE file.
 
You can use the ERRORLEVEL parameter on the IF command line in a batch
program to process exit codes returned by SETVER. For an example of a batch
program that processes exit codes, see the &lt;<a href='IF--Example.html'>IF</a>&gt; command or the &lt;<a href='Choice.html'>CHOICE</a>&gt;
command.

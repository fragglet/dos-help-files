    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

                                    MEM
 
Displays the amount of used and free memory on your computer.
 
You can use the MEM command to display information about allocated memory
areas, free memory areas, and programs that are currently loaded into
memory.
 
<b>Syntax</b>
 
    MEM [/CLASSIFY|/DEBUG|/FREE|/MODULE modulename] [/PAGE]
 
To display the status of your computer's used and free memory, use the
following syntax:
 
    MEM
 
<b>Switches</b>
 
/CLASSIFY
    Lists the programs that are currently loaded into memory and shows how
    much conventional and upper memory each program is using. MEM /CLASSIFY
    also summarizes overall memory use and lists the largest free memory
    blocks. You can use the /CLASSIFY switch with /PAGE but not with other
    MEM switches. You can abbreviate /CLASSIFY as /C.
 
/DEBUG
    Lists the programs and internal drivers that are currently loaded into
    memory. MEM /DEBUG shows each module's size, segment address, and module
    type, summarizes overall memory use, and displays other information
    useful for programming. You can use the /DEBUG switch with /PAGE but not
    with other MEM switches. You can abbreviate /DEBUG as /D.
 
/FREE
    Lists the free areas of conventional and upper memory. MEM /FREE shows
    the segment address and size of each free area of conventional memory,
    and shows the largest free upper memory block in each region of upper
    memory. You can use the /FREE switch with /PAGE but not with other MEM
    switches. You can abbreviate /FREE as /F.
 
/MODULE programname
    Shows how a program module is currently using memory. You must specify
    the program name after the /MODULE switch. MEM /MODULE lists the areas
    of memory the specified program module has allocated and shows the
    address and size of each area. You can use the /MODULE switch with
    /PAGE, but not with other MEM switches. You can abbreviate /MODULE as
    /M.
 
/PAGE
    Pauses after each screen of output. This switch can be used with any of
    the other MEM switches.

<b>How Fastopen tracks information</b>
 
Every time you open a file, Fastopen records its name and location in the
name cache. If you later reopen a file recorded by Fastopen, the access time
is greatly reduced.
 
<b>Limits on using Fastopen</b>
 
Fastopen works only on hard disks and does not work over a network. You can
use Fastopen with as many as 24 hard-disk partitions at one time. For each
partition, Fastopen can track the number of files specified by the n
parameter. The maximum number of files that Fastopen can track on all
partitions is 999.
 
You cannot run more than one copy of Fastopen at the same time. If you want
to change the Fastopen settings, you must restart MS-DOS.
 
You should not use the Fastopen command from MS-DOS Shell, because doing so
can lock up your machine.
 
<b>Memory requirements for Fastopen</b>
 
Fastopen requires approximately 48 bytes of memory for each file that it
tracks.
 
<b>Adding the FASTOPEN command to your CONFIG.SYS file</b>
 
You can add a Fastopen command to your CONFIG.SYS file by using the INSTALL
command. Use this technique when you do not want to start Fastopen from the
MS-DOS command line or from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

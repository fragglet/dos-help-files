    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

                                   APPEND
 
Enables programs to open data files in specified directories as if the files
were in the current directory. Do not use this command when Windows is
running.
 
The specified directories are called appended directories because, for the
sake of opening data files, they can be found as if they were appended to
the current directory.
 
<b>Syntax</b>
 
    APPEND [[drive:]path[;...]] [/X[:ON|:OFF]][/PATH:ON|/PATH:OFF] [/E]
 
To display the list of appended directories, use the following syntax:
 
    APPEND
 
To cancel the existing list of appended directories, use the following
syntax:
 
    APPEND ;
 
<b>Parameters</b>
 
[drive:]path
    Specifies the drive (if other than the current drive) and directory that
    you want to append to the current directory. You can specify multiple
    entries of [drive:]path, separating the entries with semicolons.
 
;
    When used by itself (APPEND ;), cancels the existing list of appended
    directories.
 
<b>Switches</b>
 
/X[:ON|:OFF]
    Specifies whether MS-DOS is to search (/X:ON) or not search (/X:OFF)
    appended directories when executing programs. You can abbreviate /X:ON
    to /X. If you want to specify X:ON, you must do it the first time you
    use APPEND after starting your system. After that, you can switch
    between X:ON and X:OFF. The default value is /X:OFF.
 
/PATH:ON|/PATH:OFF
    Specifies whether a program is to search appended directories for a data
    file when a path is already included with the name of the file the
    program is looking for. The default setting is /PATH:ON.
 
/E
    Assigns the list of appended directories to an environment variable
    named APPEND. This switch can be used only the first time you use APPEND
    after starting your system. If you use /E, you can use the SET command
    to display the list of appended directories. For information about
    environment variables, see the &lt;<a href='SET.html'>SET</a>&gt; command.
 
<b>Caution</b>
 
Do not use Append with Microsoft Windows or the Windows Setup program.
 
<b>Related Command</b>
 
To set a search path for executable files, see the &lt;<a href='PATH.html'>PATH</a>&gt; command.

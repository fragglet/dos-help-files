                              DRVSPACE /MOUNT
 
Establishes a connection between a compressed volume file (CVF) and a drive
letter so that you can use the files the CVF contains. DriveSpace usually
mounts CVFs automatically. You need to mount a CVF only if you previously
unmounted it, or if the CVF is located on a floppy disk and Automount is
disabled.
 
<b>Syntax</b>
 
    DRVSPACE /MOUNT[=nnn] drive1: [/NEWDRIVE=drive2:]
 
<b>Parameter</b>
 
drive1:
    Specifies the drive that contains the compressed volume file you want to
    mount. You must specify a drive letter.
 
<b>Switches</b>
 
/MOUNT=nnn
    Directs DriveSpace to mount the compressed volume file with the filename
    extension specified by the nnn parameter. For example, to mount a CVF
    named DRVSPACE.001, you would specify /MOUNT=001. If you omit the nnn
    parameter, DriveSpace attempts to mount the compressed volume file named
    DRVSPACE.000. The /MOUNT switch can be abbreviated as /MO.
 
/NEWDRIVE=drive2:
    Specifies the drive letter to assign to the new drive. This switch is
    optional; if you don't specify a drive letter, DriveSpace assigns the
    new drive the next available drive letter. This switch can be
    abbreviated as /NEW.

                                  UNDELETE
 
Restores files that were previously deleted by using the &lt;<a href='Del.html'>DEL</a>&gt; command.
 
UNDELETE offers three levels of protecting files against accidental
deletion── Delete Sentry, Delete Tracker, and standard. For information
about each level of protection, see Notes.
 
For information about the Windows version of UNDELETE, see the chapter
"Managing Your System" in the MS-DOS User's Guide, or see Windows Undelete
Help.
 
<b>Syntax</b>
 
    UNDELETE [[drive:][path]filename] [/DT|/DS|/DOS]
 
    UNDELETE [/LIST|/ALL|/PURGE[drive]|/STATUS|/LOAD|/UNLOAD
    |/S[drive]|/Tdrive[-entries]]
 
<b>Parameter</b>
 
[drive:][path]filename
    Specifies the location and name of the file or set of files you want to
    recover. By default, UNDELETE restores all deleted files in the current
    directory.
 
<b>Switches</b>
 
/LIST
    Lists the deleted files that are available to be recovered, but does not
    recover any files. The [drive:][path]filename parameter and the /DT,
    /DS, and /DOS switches control the listing produced by this switch.
 
/ALL
    Recovers deleted files without prompting for confirmation on each file.
    UNDELETE uses the Delete Sentry method, if it is present. If Delete
    Sentry is not, UNDELETE uses Delete Tracker, if present. Otherwise,
    UNDELETE recovers files from the DOS directory, supplying a number sign
    (#) for the missing first character in the filename. If a duplicate
    filename already exists, this switch next tries each of the following
    characters, in the order listed, until the result is a unique filename:
    #%&amp;0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.
 
/DOS
    Recovers only those files that are internally listed as deleted by
    MS-DOS, prompting for confirmation on each file. If a deletion-tracking
    file exists, this switch causes UNDELETE to ignore it.
 
/DT
    Recovers only those files listed in the deletion-tracking file,
    prompting for confirmation on each file.
 
/DS
    Recovers only those files listed in the SENTRY directory, prompting for
    confirmation on each file.
 
/LOAD
    Loads the Undelete memory-resident program into memory using information
    defined in the UNDELETE.INI file. If the UNDELETE.INI file does not
    exist, UNDELETE uses default values.
 
/UNLOAD
    Unloads the memory-resident portion of the Undelete program from memory,
    turning off the capability to restore deleted files.
 
/PURGE[drive]
    Deletes the contents of the SENTRY directory. If no drive is specified,
    UNDELETE searches the current drive for the directory.
 
/STATUS
    Displays the type of delete protection in effect for each drive.
 
/S[drive]
    Enables the Delete Sentry level of protection and loads the
    memory-resident portion of the UNDELETE program. The program records
    information used to recover deleted files on the specified drive. If you
    do not specify a drive, using this switch enables the Delete Sentry
    level of protection on the current drive. Specifying the /S switch loads
    the memory-resident program into memory using the information defined in
    the UNDELETE.INI file.
 
/Tdrive[-entries]
    Enables the Delete Tracker level of protection and loads the
    memory-resident portion of the UNDELETE program. The program records
    information used to recover deleted files. The required drive parameter
    specifies the drive containing the disk for which you want UNDELETE to
    save information about deleted files. The optional entries parameter,
    which must be a value in the range 1 through 999, specifies the maximum
    number of entries in the deletion-tracking file (PCTRACKR.DEL). The
    default value for entries depends upon the type of disk being tracked.
    The following list shows each disk size, its default number of entries,
    and its corresponding file size:
 
<b>Disk       Entries  File size</b>
<b>size</b>
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
360K       25       5K
 
720K       50       9K
 
1.2 MB     75       14K
 
1.44 MB    75       14K
 
20 MB      101      18K
 
32 MB      202      36K
 
&gt;32 MB     303      55K
 
    CAUTION:  Do not use deletion tracking for any drive that has been
              redirected by using the JOIN or SUBST command. If you intend
              to use the ASSIGN command, you must do so before using
              UNDELETE to install deletion tracking.

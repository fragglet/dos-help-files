     Error U1513
 
     nonincremental update requires all .SBR files
 
     An attempt was made to build a new database, but one or more of
     the specified .SBR files was truncated. This message is always
     preceded by warning U4502, which will give the name of the .SBR
     file that caused the error.
 
     PWBRMAKE can process a truncated, or zero-length, .SBR file only
     when a database already exists and is being incrementally updated.
 
     One of the following may be a cause:
 
        ■ The database was deleted.
 
        ■ The wrong database name was specified.
 
        ■ The database file was corrupted, requiring a full build.

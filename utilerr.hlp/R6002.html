     Run-time error R6002
 
     floating-point support not loaded
 
     The program needs the floating-point library, but the library was
     not linked to the program.
 
     One of the following may have occurred:
 
        ■ The program was compiled or linked with an option (such as
          /FPi87) that required a coprocessor, but the program was run
          on a machine that did not have a coprocessor installed.
 
        ■ A format string for a printf or scanf function contained a
          floating-point format specification, and the program did not
          contain any floating-point values or variables.
 
          The compiler minimizes a program's size by loading floating-
          point support only when necessary. It cannot detect floating-
          point format specifications in format strings, so it does not
          load the necessary floating-point routines.
 
          Use a floating-point argument to correspond to the floating-
          point format specification, or perform a floating-point
          assignment elsewhere in the program. This causes floating-
          point support to be loaded.
 
        ■ In a mixed-language program, a C library was specified before
          a FORTRAN library when the program was linked. Relink and
          specify the C library last.

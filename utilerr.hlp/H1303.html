     HELPMAKE error H1303
 
     unknown RTF attribute
 
     An unknown RTF formatting command was found.
 
     One of the following may have occurred:
 
        ■ A new RTF attribute was used. HELPMAKE recognizes a set of
          attributes that were current at the time this version of
          HELPMAKE was created. It interprets some of the attributes
          and knows to ignore the others. Any RTF attribute defined
          after HELPMAKE was created is not known by HELPMAKE and will
          cause this error.
 
        ■ The RTF file is corrupted.
                                    -♦-

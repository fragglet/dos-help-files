     The /Zr option checks for null or out-of-range pointers in your
     program. A run-time error occurs if you try to run a program with
     such pointers. The /Zr option is only available with the fast
     compile (/f) option.
 
     If you compile with the /Zr option, you can use the
     check_pointer pragma within your source file to turn checking
     on or off only for selected pointers leaving the default (see
     below) for the remaining pointers in the program. When you want to
     turn on pointer checking, put the following line before the usage
     of the pointer you want to check:
 
          #pragma check_pointer (on)
 
     This line turns on pointer checking for all pointers that follow
     it in the source file, not just the pointers on the following
     line. To turn off pointer checking, insert the following line at
     the location you want pointer checking turned off:
 
          #pragma check_pointer (off)
 
     If you don't give an argument for the check_pointer pragma,
     pointer checking reverts to the behavior specified on the command
     line: turned on if the /Zr option is given or turned off
     otherwise.
 
     For example:
 
          /Zr PROG.C
 
     This command causes CL to check for null or out-of-range pointers
     in the file PROG.C. All pointers in the file are checked except
     those to which a check_pointer(off) pragma applies.

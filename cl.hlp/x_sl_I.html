     Syntax:  /I directory
              /X
 
     Option   Description
 
     /I       Causes compiler to search the specified &lt;directory&gt;
              for include files
 
     /X       Causes compiler not to search standard directories for
              include files
 
     The /I and /X options temporarily override or change the effects
     of the INCLUDE environment variable. Overriding INCLUDE allows you
     to give a particular file special handling without changing the
     compiler environment you usually use.
 
     You can add to the list of directories where the compiler searches
     for include files with the /I option. This option causes the
     compiler to search the directory or directories you specify before
     searching the standard directories given by the INCLUDE
     environment variable.
 
     You can add more than one include directory by entering the /I
     option more than once on the CL command line. The compiler
     searches the directories in the order they appear on the command
     line.
 
     The compiler searches the directories until it finds the specified
     include file. If the compiler doesn't find the file, it prints an
     error message and stops processing.
 
     The /X option is often used with the /I option to define the
     location of include files with the same names as include files
     found in the standard include directories but with different
     definitions.

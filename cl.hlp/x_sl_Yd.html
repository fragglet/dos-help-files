     Syntax:  /Yd
 
     The /Yd option allows you to override the default placement of
     CodeView information in object files. It is used with precompiled
     headers created with the /Zi option. The option takes no argument
     and has effect only if both the create precompiled header (/Yc)
     and the generate CodeView information (/Zi) options are in effect.
 
     By default, any CodeView debugging information (symbols and type
     information) for a precompiled header is placed in the object file
     for which a .PCH file is created, rather than in the .PCH file
     itself. When you create other object files using this .PCH file,
     the new object files do not replicate the same debugging
     information. Instead, they simply cross-reference the debugging
     information contained in the original object file. Because the
     information is cross-referenced through the original object file,
     rather than replicated in multiple object files, you can save disk
     space and speed up the build process.
 
     When you create a precompiled header and use /Yd, the .PCH file
     itself contains the debugging information. When you use a
     precompiled header (/Yu) and use /Yd, the debugging information is
     replicated in the resulting object file.
 
     If a precompiled header was not compiled with /Zi, you can still
     use it in later compilations using /Zi. However, the debugging
     information will be placed in the current object file, and local
     symbols for functions defined in the precompiled header will not
     be available to CodeView.

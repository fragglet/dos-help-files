     You can override the default addressing convention for a given
     function, function call, or data reference by declaring code or
     data items as near, far, huge, or based. You don't need to change
     the addressing conventions for the program as a whole. Simply use
     the __near, __far, __huge, or __based keywords.
 
     __near Keyword
 
        ■ Data resides in the default data segment. It is referenced
          with 16-bit addresses (pointers to data are 16 bits).
 
        ■ Function is assumed to be in the current code segment. It is
          referenced with 16-bit addresses (pointers to functions are
          16 bits) and called with short call.
 
        ■ Variables declared with the __near keyword use 16-bit pointer
          arithmetic.
 
     __far Keyword
 
        ■ Data can be anywhere in memory. It is not assumed to reside
          in the current data segment. Data items are assumed not to
          cross segment boundaries and are referenced with 32-bit
          addresses (pointers to data are 32 bits).
 
        ■ Function is not assumed to be in the current code segment. It
          is referenced with 32-bit addresses (pointers to functions
          are 32 bits) and called with far call.
 
        ■ Variables declared with the __far keyword use 16-bit pointer
          arithmetic.
 
     __huge Keyword
 
        ■ Data can be anywhere in memory. It is not assumed to reside
          in the current data segment. Individual arrays can exceed 64K
          in size. Data is referenced with 32-bit addresses (pointers
          to data are 32 bits).
 
        ■ The __huge keyword is not applicable to functions.
 
        ■ Variables declared with the __huge keyword use 32-bit pointer
          arithmetic for data (same restrictions as for __huge array).
 
     __based Keyword
 
        ■ Data can be anywhere in memory. It is not assumed to reside
          in the current data segment. The range of 32-bit addresses is
          provided by 16-bit addresses plus a known base.
 
        ■ Variables declared with the __based keyword use 16-bit pointer
          arithmetic for data.

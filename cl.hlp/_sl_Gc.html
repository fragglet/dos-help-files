─────C/C++ Compiler─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
     If you use the /Gc option, the entire module is compiled using the
     Pascal/FORTRAN calling and naming conventions. You might use this
     method to make it possible to call all the functions in a C module
     from another language or to gain the performance and size
     improvement provided by this calling convention.
 
     For the Pascal calling convention, the leftmost argument is pushed
     on the stack first, the rightmost last. For the naming convention,
     no special characters are prepended to public Pascal-type functions
     and all names are translated into uppercase.
 
     When you use /Gc to compile a module, the compiler assumes that all
     functions called from that module use the Pascal/FORTRAN calling
     convention, even if the functions are defined outside that module.
     Therefore, using /Gc would usually mean that you cannot call or
     define functions that take variable numbers of parameters and that
     you cannot call functions such as the C library functions that use
     the C calling sequence. In addition, if you compile with the /Gc
     option, either you must declare the main function in the source
     program with the __cdecl keyword, or you must change the startup
     routine so that it uses the correct naming and calling conventions
     when calling main.
 
     NOTES:
 
        ■ The varargs and stdargs macros are incompatible with the
          Pascal convention.
 
        ■ You can cause individual functions to observe the Pascal
          conventions by declaring them with the __pascal keyword.

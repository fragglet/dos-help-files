─────C/C++ Compiler─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
     A filename can contain any combination of uppercase and lowercase
     letters, hyphens, underscores, and a period. Any filename can
     include a full or partial path. A full path includes a drive name
     of the form D: and one or more directory names separated by
     backslashes (\). A partial path omits the drive name, which CL
     assumes to be the current drive. If you don't specify any path, CL
     assumes the file is in the current directory.
 
     CL determines how to process each file depending on its filename
     extension, as follows:
 
     Extension     Processing
 
     .C            CL assumes the file is a C source file and
                   compiles it.
 
     .CXX, .CPP    CL assumes the file is a C++ source file and
                   compiles it.
 
     .OBJ          CL assumes the file is an object file and passes
                   its name to the linker.
 
     .LIB          CL assumes the file is a library and passes its
                   name to the linker. The linker links this library
                   with the object files CL created from source files
                   and the object files given on the command line.
 
     .ASM          CL assumes the file is an assembly file and invokes
                   MASM to assemble it.
 
     .DEF          CL assumes the file is a definition file and passes
                   its name to the linker.
 
      For any other extension or no extension, CL assumes the file is an
      object file and passes its name to the linker.

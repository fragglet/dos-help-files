    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

     Programs compiled with the /FPi option automatically use an 8087
     or 80287 coprocessor at run time if one is installed. You can
     override this and force the use of the emulator instead by setting
     an environment variable named NO87.
 
     If NO87 is set to any value when the program is executed, the
     program will use the emulator even if a coprocessor is present.
     When this occurs, the NO87 setting is displayed on the standard
     output as a message. The message is printed if a coprocessor is
     present and suppressed, or if no coprocessor is present. For
     instance:
 
          SET NO87=Use of coprocessor suppressed
 
     In the example above, the message "Use of coprocessor suppressed"
     will appear when a program that could use an 80x87 coprocessor is
     executed on a computer that has such a coprocessor.
 
     If you want to force use of the emulator but don't want a message
     to appear, set NO87 equal to one or more spaces. The variable is
     still considered to be defined:
 
          SET NO87=
 
     The example above sets the NO87 variable to the space character.
     Use of the coprocessor is still suppressed, but no message is
     displayed.
 
     Note that the presence or absence of the NO87 definition
     determines whether use of the coprocessor is suppressed. The
     actual value of the NO87 setting is used only for the message.
 
     The NO87 variable takes effect with any program linked with an
     emulator library (mLIBCE.LIB). It has no effect on programs linked
     with 80x87 libraries (mLIBC7.LIB).

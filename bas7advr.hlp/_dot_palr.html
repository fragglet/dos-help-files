The PALETTE statement changes one or more colors in the palette. The
PALETTE statement works only on systems equipped with the EGA, VGA, or
MCGA adapters. The PALETTE statement is not supported in screen mode 3 or 4.
 
<b>PALETTE [attribute%,color&amp;]</b>
    ■ The argument color&amp; must be a long integer expression for the IBM Video
      Graphics Array adapter (VGA) and IBM Multicolor Graphics Array
      adapter (MCGA) in screen modes 11 to 13. Integer or long-integer
      expressions can be used with the IBM Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA).
    ■ The table below lists attribute and color ranges for various adapter
      types and screen modes. See the SCREEN statement for a list of
      colors available for various screen modes, monitor, and graphics
      adapter combinations.

<b>PALETTE USING array-name [(array-index)]</b>
    ■ The argument array-name is an array that contains more than one display
      color. It must be a long integer array for VGA and MCGA adapters in
      screen modes 11 to 13. Otherwise, the array can be either an integer
      or long-integer array.
    ■ The argument array-index is the index of the first array element
      to use in setting the palette.
    ■ With USING PALETTE, all entries in the palette can be modified in
      one statement. Each attribute in the palette is assigned a
      corresponding color from the array.
      - A color argument of -1 in the array leaves the attribut
        unchanged in the palette. (All other negative numbers are
        invalid values for color.)
      - The dimensions for the array must be large enough to set all
        the palette entries after array-index. For example, if you
        are assigning colors to a palette with 16 attributes and the
        argument array-index is 5 (the first array element to use
        in resetting the palette), then the dimensions for the array
        must be large enough to hold at least 20 elements (because
        the number of elements from 5 to 20, inclusive, is 16):
 
            DIM PAL%(20)
            ' Other statements can go here.
            PALETTE USING PAL%(5)
 
Usage Notes
    ■ The PALETTE statement provides a way of mapping display colors
      (the actual binary values used by the adapter) to color attributes
      (a smaller set of values).
    ■ When a program enters a screen mode, the attributes are set to a
      series of default color values. See the <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='_dot_screensr.html'>SCREEN Statement Details</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
      for a list of the default colors.
        ║ Note: In the EGA, VGA, and MCGA adapters the default values
        ║       have been selected so the display shows the same colors,
        ║       even though the EGA uses different color values.
      Use the PALETTE statement to assign different colors to the attributes.
    ■ Use a PALETTE statement with no arguments to set the palette back to
      the default color values.
    ■ After a PALETTE statement is executed with arguments, the graphics
      adapter subsequently uses the display color associated with the
      attribute whenever an attribute argument appears in a statement
      such as DRAW or LINE. Changing the display color assigned to an
      attribute changes those colors currently displayed on the screen
      associated with that attribute. For example, assume that the current
      palette contains colors 0, 1, 2, and 3 in the four attributes
      numbered 0, 1, 2, and 3. The following DRAW statement selects
      attribute 3, and draws a line of 100 pixels using the display
      color associated with attribute 3, in this case also 3:
 
          DRAW "C3L100"
 
      If the following statement is executed, the color associated with
      attribute 3 is changed to color 2:
 
          PALETTE 3,2
 
      All text or graphics currently on the screen displayed using
      attribute 3, including the line that is 100 pixels long, are
      instantaneously changed to color 2. Text or graphics subsequently
      displayed with attribute 3 are also displayed in color 2. The new
      palette of colors contains 0, 1, 2, and 2.
    ■ Attribute 0 is always the screen background color. Under a common
      initial palette setting, points colored with the attribute 0 appear
      black on the display screen. Using the PALETTE statement, you could,
      for example, change the mapping of attribute 0 from black to white.
    ■ You also can use the COLOR statement to change the screen background
      color in modes 1 and 7 through 10.
    ■ The 64 EGA colors are derived from four levels each of red, green,
      and blue. For example, black is composed of red, green, and blue
      levels of (0,0,0), bright white is (3,3,3), dark gray is (1,1,1), etc.
      The best way to see the BASIC color code (0 through 63) associated with
      each combination of red, green, and blue levels is to run the
      following program:
 
        ' Display the EGA color codes 1 through 63
        ' using color code 0 (black) as background.
        DEFINT A-Z
        SCREEN 9                      ' Establish EGA screen mode.
        ' Display a set of nine color bars.
        FOR CC% = 1 TO 9
          LINE (((CC% * 64) - 24), 40)-STEP(60, 140), CC%, BF
        NEXT CC%
        ' Display seven sets of nine color bars.
        ' A new set is displayed each time user presses a key.
        FOR Set% = 0 TO 6
          FOR ColorBar% = 1 TO 9
            DisplayCode% = (Set% * 9) + ColorBar%
            LOCATE 15, (ColorBar% * 8)
            PRINT DisplayCode%
            PALETTE ColorBar%, DisplayCode%
          NEXT ColorBar%
          SLEEP
        NEXT Set
        END
 
    ■ To calculate a VGA color value, select the intensities of red, green,
      and blue. The intensity of a color is a number from 0 (low intensity)
      to 63 (high intensity). Then use the following formula to calculate
      the actual color number:
 
         color number = 65536 * blue + 256 * green + red
 
      This formula yields integer values from 0 to 4,144,959, but
      because there are gaps in the range of color numbers, you should
      use the formula rather than just select a number.
    ■ When used with the IBM Analog Monochrome Monitor, the VGA color
      values are converted to a gray-scale value by taking a weighted sum
      of the red, blue, and green intensities:
 
         gray value = 11% blue + 59% green + 30% red
 
      For example, if the blue, green, and red intensities are 45, 20,
      and 20, the gray intensity value calculation would be
 
         gray value = (.11 * 45) + (.59 * 20) + (.30 * 20) = 22
 
      The fractional part of the result is dropped.

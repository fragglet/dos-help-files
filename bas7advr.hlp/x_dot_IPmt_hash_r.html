IPmt# returns the interest payment for a given period of an annuity based
on periodic, constant payments and a constant interest rate.
 
<b>IPmt# (rate#, per#, nper#, pv#, fv#, type%, status%)</b>
    ■ The argument rate# is the interest rate per period. For example,
      if you get a car loan at a 10% annual interest rate and make monthly
      payments, the rate per period would be .10/12, or .0083.
    ■ The argument nper# is the total number of payment periods in an
      annuity. For example, if you get a 4-year car loan and make monthly
      payments, your loan has a total number of 4x12, or 48 payment periods.
    ■ The arguments rate# and nper# must use consistent units. For example:
 
        rate#     nper#    Loan description
        ══════    ═════    ════════════════════════════
        .10/12    4*12     Monthly payment, 4-year loan,
                           10% annual interest
        .10       4        Annual payment, 4-year loan,
                           10% annual interest
 
    ■ The argument pv# is the present value, or lump sum that a series of
      payments to be paid in the future is worth now. For example, when
      you borrow money to buy a car, the loan amount is the present value
      to the lender of the monthly car payments you will make.
    ■ The argument fv# is the future value, or cash balance sometime in
      the future after the final payment is made. The future value of a
      loan, for example, is 0. As another example, if you think you will
      need $50,000 in 18 years to pay for your child's education, then
      $50,000 is the future value.
    ■ The argument status% can be any variable that returns information
      about the success or failure of the calculation. The value of status%
      will be 0 if the calculation was successful, and 1 if it was not.
 
Usage Notes
    ■ An annuity is a series of constant cash payments made over a
      continuous period of time. An annuity can be a loan (such as a
      home mortgage), or an investment (such as a monthly savings plan).
    ■ For all arguments, cash you pay out, such as deposits to savings,
      is represented by negative numbers; cash you receive, such as
      dividend checks, is represented by positive numbers.
 
Important
    ■ To use IPmt# in the QBX environment, use the FINANCER.QLB Quick
      library. To use IPmt# outside the QBX environment, link your program
      with the appropriate FINANCxx.LIB file. Depending on the compiler
      options you chose when you installed BASIC, one or more of the
      following files will be available:
 
           Filename         Compiler options
           ════════════     ═════════════════════════════════════════════
           FINANCER.LIB     80x87 or emulator math; DOS or OS/2 real mode
           FINANCAR.LIB     Alternate math; DOS or OS/2 real mode
           FINANCEP.LIB     80x87 or emulator math, OS/2 protected mode
           FINANCAP.LIB     Alternate math; OS/2 protected mode
 
    ■ The FINANC.BI header file contains the necessary function
      declarations for IPmt#.
    ■ For more information on using libraries, see "Creating and Using
      Quick Libraries" and "Using LINK and LIB" in the BASIC Programmer's
      Guide.

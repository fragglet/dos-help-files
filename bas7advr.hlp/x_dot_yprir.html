    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

The PRINT statement outputs data to the screen.
 
<b>PRINT  [expressionlist] [{;|,}]</b>
    ■ The argument expressionlist can contain numeric or string expressions.
      String literals must be enclosed in quotation marks.
    ■ The PRINT statement supports only elementary BASIC data types
      (integers, long integers, single-precision real numbers, double-
      precision real numbers, currency, and strings). To print information
      from a record, use individual record element names in the PRINT
      statement, as in the following code fragment:
 
          TYPE MyType
            Word AS STRING * 20
            Count AS LONG
          END TYPE
          DIM Myrec AS MyType
 
          PRINT Myrec.Word
 
Usage Notes
    ■ Item-Format Rules
        -  A printed number is always followed by a space.
        -  If the number is positive, it is also preceded by a space;
           if the number is negative, it is preceded by a minus sign (-).
        -  If a single-precision number can be expressed as seven or fewer
           digits with no loss of accuracy, then it is printed in fixed-
           point format; otherwise, floating-point format is used. For
           example, the number 1.1E-6 is displayed as .0000011, but the
           number 1.1E-7 is displayed as 1.1E-7.
        -  If a double-precision number can be expressed as 15 or fewer
           digits and with no loss of accuracy, then it is printed in
           fixed-point format; otherwise, floating-point format is used.
           For example, the number 1.1D-14 is displayed as .000000000000011,
           but the number 1.1D-15 is displayed as 1.1D-15.
 
    ■ Print-Line Format Rules
        -  The print line is divided into print zones of 14 spaces each.
        -  The position of each printed item is determined by the
           punctuation used to separate the items in expressionlist:
             A semicolon makes the next value print immediately
             after the last value.
             A comma makes the next value print at the start of the
             next zone.
             Using one or more spaces or tabs between expressions
             has the same effect as using a semicolon.
        -  If a comma or a semicolon terminates the list of expressions, the
           next PRINT statement to execute prints on the same line, after
           spacing accordingly.
        -  If the expression list ends without a comma or a semicolon,
           a carriage-return-and-line-feed sequence are printed at the end of
           the line.
        -  If the printed line is wider than the screen width, BASIC
           goes to the next physical line and continues printing.

BSAVE transfers the contents of an area of memory to an output file
or device.
 
<b>BSAVE filespec$, offset%, length%</b>
    ■ The argument filespec$ is a string expression that specifies the file
      or device on which to save a memory-image file.
 
Usage Notes
    ■ The BSAVE statement allows data or programs to be saved as
      memory-image files on disk. A memory-image file is a byte-for-byte
      copy of what is in memory along with control information used by
      BLOAD to load the file.
    ■ The starting address of the area saved is determined by the offset
      and the most recent DEF SEG statement.
    ■ If no DEF SEG statement is executed before the BSAVE statement,
      the program uses the default BASIC data segment (DGROUP). Otherwise,
      BSAVE begins saving at the address specified by the offset and by
      the segment set in the most recent DEF SEG statement.
    ■ If the offset is a long integer, or a single- or double-precision
      floating-point number between -1 and -32,768, inclusive, it is
      treated as an unsigned 2-byte offset.
 
BSAVE and Expanded Memory Arrays
    ■ Do not use BSAVE to transfer an expanded memory array to an output
      file. If you start QBX with the /Ea switch, any of these arrays may
      be stored in expanded memory:
          -  Numeric arrays &lt; 16K in size
          -  Fixed-length string arrays &lt; 16K in size
          -  User-defined-type arrays &lt; 16K in size
    ■ If you want to use BSAVE to transfer an array to an output file,
      first start QBX without the /Ea switch. (Without the /Ea switch, no
      arrays are stored in expanded memory.)
    ■ For more information on using expanded memory, see
      <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='../bas7qck.hlp/x_dot_ems_dot_mm.html'>Using Expanded Memory</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>.
 
Important
    ■ Programs written in earlier versions of BASIC no longer work
      if they use VARPTR to access numeric arrays.
    ■ Because different screen modes use memory differently, do not load
      graphic images in a screen mode other than the one used when they
      were created.
 
Differences From BASICA
    ■ BSAVE does not support the cassette device.

The STRIG statements enable, disable, or suspend trapping of joystick
activity.
 
<b>STRIG(n%) ON</b>
<b>STRIG(n%) OFF</b>
<b>STRIG(n%) STOP</b>
 
Usage Notes
    ■ STRIG(n%) ON enables joystick-event trapping. If joystick trigger
      n% is pressed after a STRIG(n%) ON statement, the routine
      specified in the ON STRIG statement is executed.
    ■ STRIG(n%) OFF disables joystick-event trapping. No trapping takes
      place until another STRIG(n%) ON statement is executed. Events
      occurring while trapping is off are ignored.
    ■ STRIG(n%) STOP suspends joystick-event trapping. No trapping takes
      place until a STRIG(n%) ON statement is executed. Events occurring
      while trapping is suspended are remembered and processed when the
      next STRIG(n%) ON statement is executed. However, remembered events
      are lost if STRIG(n%) OFF is executed.
    ■ When a joystick event trap occurs (that is, the GOSUB is performed),
      an automatic STRIG(n%) STOP is executed so that recursive traps
      cannot take place. The RETURN from the trapping routine
      automatically executes a STRIG(n%) ON statement unless an explicit
      STRIG(n%) OFF was performed inside the routine.
    ■ If your program contains event-handling statements and you are
      compiling from the BC command line, use the BC /W or /V option.
      (The /W option checks for events at every label or line number; the
      /V option checks at every statement.) If you do not use these
      options and your program contains event traps, BASIC generates the
      error message, "ON event without /V or /W on command line."
    ■ In previous versions of BASIC, the statement STRIG ON enabled testing
      of the joystick triggers; STRIG OFF disabled joystick-trigger testing.
      The current version of BASIC ignores the old version of the STRIG ON
      and STRIG OFF statements.
    ■ For more information, see Chapter 9, "Event Handling" in the
      Programmer's Guide.

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

The FUNCTION statement declares the name, the parameters, and the return
type of a FUNCTION procedure.
 
<b>FUNCTION name [(parameterlist)] [STATIC]</b>
    [statementblock]
  name = expression
    [statementblock]
  [EXIT FUNCTION]
    [statementblock]
<b>END FUNCTION</b>
 
    ■ The type of name determines the type of value the function returns.
      For example, to create a function that returns a string, you would
      include a dollar sign in the name or give it a name defined as
      a string name by a DEFSTR statement. FUNCTION procedure names follow
      the rules for naming BASIC variables.
    ■ Names in the parameterlist are separated by commas. The syntax of
      parameterlist is:
 
        [BYVAL] variable[( )] [AS type] [,[BYVAL] variable[()] [AS type]]...
 
            ■ BYVAL       Defines the variable as being passed by value
                          rather than by reference (the default). BYVAL
                          can be used only with simple numeric types
                          (INTEGER, LONG, SINGLE, DOUBLE, or CURRENCY).
            ■ variable    A BASIC variable name. Previous versions of BASIC
                          required the number of dimensions in parentheses
                          after an array name. In the current version of
                          BASIC, the number of dimensions is not required.
            ■ AS type     The type of the variable: INTEGER, LONG, SINGLE,
                          DOUBLE, STRING, CURRENCY, or a user-defined
                          type. You cannot use a fixed-length string as a
                          parameter unless it is contained in an array. You
                          can use a simple fixed-length string as an
                          argument in a CALL statement; BASIC converts
                          a simple fixed-length string argument to a
                          variable-length string argument before passing
                          the string to a function.
 
    ■ STATIC indicates that the function's local variables are to
      be saved between calls. Without STATIC, the local variables are
      allocated each time the function is invoked, and the variables' values
      are lost when the function returns to the calling program. The STATIC
      attribute does not affect variables that are used in a FUNCTION
      procedure but declared outside the FUNCTION procedure in DIM or
      COMMON statements using the SHARED statement.
    ■ The expression is the return value of the function. A FUNCTION
      procedure returns a value by assigning a value to the function name.
      If no value is assigned to the FUNCTION name, the FUNCTION
      procedure returns a default value: a numeric function returns 0,
      and a string function returns the null string ("").
    ■ EXIT FUNCTION immediately exits a FUNCTION procedure. Program
      execution continues where the function was invoked. EXIT FUNCTION
      can be used only in a FUNCTION procedure. For more information,
      see the <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='../unknown.html#EXIT'>EXIT Statement</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>.
 
Usage Notes
    ■ If a parameter is passed by reference, any change to the parameter's
      value inside the procedure changes its value in the calling program.
    ■ If a parameter is passed by value, any changes to the parameter's
      value inside the procedure is local to that procedure and does not
      affect its value in the calling program.
    ■ Earlier versions of BASIC required the number of dimensions in
      parentheses after an array name. The number of dimensions is no longer
      required. Only the parentheses are required to indicate the parameter
      is an array. For example, the following statement indicates that both
      Keywords$ and KeywordTypes are arrays:
 
       FUNCTION ParseLine(Keywords$(),KeywordTypes())
 
    ■ Earlier versions of BASIC did not allow you to pass arrays
      containing fixed-length strings as parameters. BASIC now
      supports this.
    ■ A FUNCTION procedure is like a SUB procedure: it can be defined with
      parameters, perform a series of statements, and change the values of
      its parameters. A FUNCTION procedure is always used in an expression
      in the same manner as a BASIC intrinsic function.
    ■ Like SUB procedures, FUNCTION procedures can use local variables. Any
      variable referred to within the body of the function is local to
      the FUNCTION unless one of the following conditions is true:
        - The variable is declared within the function as a shared
          variable in a SHARED statement
        - The variable appears in a DIM or COMMON statement with the SHARED
          attribute at the module level.
    ■ To return a value from a function, assign the value to the function
      name. For example, in a function named BinarySearch, you might
      assign the value of the constant FALSE to the name to indicate
      the value was not found:
 
        FUNCTION BinarySearch(...)
        CONST FALSE=0
        .
        .
        .
 
        ' Value not found. Return a value of FALSE.
 
         IF Lower&gt;Upper THEN
           BinarySearch=FALSE
           EXIT FUNCTION
         END IF
        .
        .
        .
        END FUNCTION
 
    ■ Using the STATIC attribute increases execution speed slightly. STATIC
      is usually not used with recursive FUNCTION procedures.
    ■ Because BASIC may rearrange arithmetic expressions to attain greater
      efficiency, avoid using FUNCTION procedures that change program
      variables in arithmetic expressions. Also, avoid using FUNCTION
      procedures that perform I/O.
    ■ FUNCTION procedures can be recursive--they can call themselves to
      perform a given task. See the example for more information.
 
Important
    Avoid using I/O statements in a FUNCTION procedure called from an I/O
    statement; they can cause unpredictable results. Also, because BASIC may
    rearrange arithmetic expressions to attain greater efficiency, avoid
    using FUNCTION procedures that change program variables in arithmetic
    expressions.

<b>Line-Drawing and Cursor-Movement Commands</b>
 
Cursor movement commands initiate movement from the current graphics
position, which usually is the coordinates of the last graphics point
plotted with a DRAW macro-language command or another graphics command
(such as LINE or PSET).
 
<b>DRAW stringexpression$</b>
    ■ Either of two prefix commands can precede any of the other
      movement commands in stringexpression$:
        B        Move, but do not plot any points.
        N        Plot, but return to original position when done.
    ■ The following commands specify movement in terms of n units:
        - The default unit size is one pixel.
        - Unit size can be modified by the S command, which sets the
          scale factor (see <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='x_dot_acsfml.html'>Rotation, Color, and Scale-Factor Commands</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>).
        - If no unit argument is supplied, the graphics cursor is moved
          one unit.
        - The cursor-movement commands have the following effect:

            ═══════════    ═══════════════════════════════════════════
            U[n]           Move up n units.
            D[n]           Move down n units.
            L[n]           Move left n units.
            R[n]           Move right n units.
            E[n]           Move diagonally up and right n units.
            F[n]           Move diagonally down and right n units.
            G[n]           Move diagonally down and left n units.
            H[n]           Move diagonally up and left n units.
            M[{+|-}]x,y    Move absolute or relative:
                             - If x is preceded by a plus (+) or minus
                               (-), the movement is relative to the
                               current point. The x and y are added to
                               (or subtracted from) the coordinates of
                               the current graphics position and
                               movement is to that point.
                             - If no sign precedes x, the movement is
                               absolute. Movement is from the current
                               cursor position to the point with
                               coordinates x,y.
 
Usage Notes
    ■ The current position defaults to the center of the screen when a
      program begins execution.

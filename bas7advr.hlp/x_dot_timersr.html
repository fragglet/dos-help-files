The TIMER statements enable, disable, or suspend timer-event trapping.
 
<b>TIMER ON</b>
<b>TIMER OFF</b>
<b>TIMER STOP</b>
 
Usage Notes
    ■ TIMER ON enables timer-event trapping. A timer event occurs when
      n&amp; seconds have elapsed (as specified in the ON TIMER statement). If
      a timer event occurs after a TIMER ON statement, the routine
      specified in the ON TIMER statement is executed.
    ■ TIMER OFF disables timer-event trapping. No timer-event trapping
      takes place until another TIMER ON statement is executed. Events
      occurring while trapping is off are ignored.
    ■ TIMER STOP suspends timer-event trapping. No trapping takes place
      until another TIMER ON statement is executed. Events occurring while
      trapping is off are remembered and processed when the next TIMER ON
      statement is executed. However, remembered events are lost if
      TIMER OFF is executed.
    ■ When a timer-event trap occurs (that is, the GOSUB is performed),
      an automatic TIMER STOP is executed so that recursive traps cannot
      take place. The RETURN from the trapping routine automatically
      performs a TIMER ON statement unless an explicit TIMER OFF was
      performed inside the routine.
    ■ If your program contains event-handling statements and you are
      compiling from the BC command line, use the BC /W or /V option.
      (The /W option checks for events at every label or line number; the
      /V option checks at every statement.) If you do not use these
      options and your program contains event traps, BASIC generates the
      error message, "ON event without /V or /W on command line."
    ■ For more information, see Chapter 9, "Event Handling" in the
      Programmer's Guide.

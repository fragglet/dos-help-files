The EVENT statements enable or disable trapping of events.
 
<b>EVENT ON</b>
<b>EVENT OFF</b>
 
Usage Notes
    ■ The EVENT statements affect compiled code generation. When EVENT OFF
      is in effect, the compiler will not generate any event-checking code.
    ■ EVENT OFF is equivalent to compiling a program from the BC command
      line without using /V or /W. EVENT OFF can be used to create small
      and fast code that still supports event trapping.
    ■ If your program contains event-handling statements and you are
      compiling from the BC command line, use the BC /W or /V option.
      (The /W option checks for events at every label or line number; the
      /V option checks at every statement.) If you do not use these
      options and your program contains event traps, BASIC generates the
      error message, "ON event without /V or /W on command line."
    ■ EVENT OFF and EVENT ON can be used to bracket sections of code
      where events do not need to be detected and trapped, and fast
      performance is required. Events still could be detected and tracked
      if a routine using EVENT ON were called from a section of EVENT OFF
      code.
    ■ If an event occurs while EVENT OFF is in effect, this event is still
      remembered and then is handled as soon as an EVENT ON block is
      entered.

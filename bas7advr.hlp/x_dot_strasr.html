The StringAssign routine is used in mixed-language programming to transfer
a string from BASIC to a non-BASIC routine or from a non-BASIC routine to
BASIC. A typical use is to transfer a string from BASIC to a non-BASIC
routine, process the string using the non-BASIC routine, and then
transfer the modified string back to BASIC.
 
<b>StringAssign(sourceaddress&amp;, sourcelength%, destaddress&amp;, destlength%);</b>
    ■ The preceding syntax is for the C language. However, the order of the
      arguments in the syntax follows BASIC, Pascal, and FORTRAN calling
      conventions rather than the C calling convention. (In BASIC, Pascal,
      and FORTRAN, the arguments are passed in the order in which they
      appear in the source code. In C, the arguments are passed in the
      reverse order.)
    ■ For C, MASM, Pascal, and FORTRAN examples, see Chapter 13,
      "Mixed-Language Programming with Far Strings" in the Programmer's Guide.
 
Usage Notes
    ■ Calls to the StringAssign routine are usually made from a C, MASM,
      Pascal, or FORTRAN routine that is going to perform string processing
      functions on BASIC strings. Seldom, if ever, would you call
      StringAssign from inside a BASIC program.
    ■ StringAssign can be used to transfer both near and far strings. Using
      StringAssign, you can write mixed-language programs that are near
      string/far string independent.
    ■ MASM, C, Pascal and FORTRAN deal only with fixed-length strings.
      When programming in these languages you can use StringAssign to
      create a new BASIC variable-length string and transfer fixed-
      length string data to it. For example, to transfer a MASM fixed-length
      string containing the word "Hello" to a BASIC variable-length string,
      you use this data structure:
 
        fixedstring      db       "Hello"     ; source of data
        descriptor       dd        0          ; descriptor for destination
 
      The second data element, descriptor, is a 4-byte string descriptor
      initialized to zero. BASIC interprets this to mean that it should
      create a new variable-length string and associate it with the address
      labelled descriptor.
 
      To create a new BASIC variable-length string and transfer fixed-length
      data to it, the StringAssign routine requires four arguments:
 
        - The far address of the fixed-length string in the MASM data
          segment
        - The length of the fixed-length string in the MASM data segment.
        - The far address of the string descriptor in the MASM data
          segment
        - 0 (indicating the string in the BASIC data segment will be a
          variable-length string)
 
      The following MASM code pushes these arguments on the stack and calls
      StringAssign:
 
        .model
        extrn        stringassign:  far
 
        .code
        push         ds                    ; segment of fixed-length string
        lea          ax, fixedstring       ; offset of fixed-length string
        push         ax
        mov          ax, 5                 ; length of "Hello"
        push         ax
        push         ds                    ; segment of descriptor
        lea          ax, descriptor        ; offset of descriptor
        push         ax
        mov          ax, 0                 ; 0 = variable-length string
        push         ax
        call         stringassign
 
      When the call to StringAssign is made, BASIC will fill in the double
      word descriptor with the correct string descriptor.
    ■ For detailed instructions on mixed-language programming with strings,
      see "Mixed-Language Programming with Far Strings" and "Mixed-Language
      Programming with Near Strings" in the Programmer's Guide.
 
Important
      When creating a new variable-length string you must allocate four
      bytes of static data for a string descriptor as shown above.
      Allocating the data on the stack will not work.

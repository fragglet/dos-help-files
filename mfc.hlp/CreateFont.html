  Parameter         Description
 
  &lt;nHeight&gt;         Specifies the desired height (in logical units) of the
                    font. The font height can be specified in three ways.
 
                    Height           Result
 
                    Greater than 0   Height is transformed into device
                                     units and matched against the cell
                                     height of the available fonts.
 
                    Equal to 0       A reasonable default size is used.
 
                    Less than 0      Height is transformed into device
                                     units and the absolute value is
                                     matched against the character height
                                     of the available fonts.
 
                    For all height comparisons, the font mapper looks for
                    the largest font that does not exceed the requested
                    size. Then, if there is no such font, it looks for the
                    smallest font available.
 
  &lt;nWidth&gt;          Specifies the average width (in logical units) of
                    characters in the font. If &lt;nWidth&gt; is 0, the aspect
                    ratio of the device will be matched against the
                    digitization aspect ratio of the available fonts to
                    find the closest match, which is determined by the
                    absolute value of the difference.
 
  &lt;nEscapement&gt;     Specifies the angle (in 0.1-degree units) between the
                    escapement vector and the x-axis of the display
                    surface. The escapement vector is the line through the
                    origins of the first and last characters on a line.
                    The angle is measured counterclockwise from the
                    x-axis.
 
  &lt;nOrientation&gt;    Specifies the angle (in 0.1-degree units) between the
                    baseline of a character and the x-axis. The angle is
                    measured counterclockwise from the x-axis.
 
  &lt;nWeight&gt;         Specifies the font weight (in inked pixels per 1000).
                    Although &lt;nWeight&gt; can be any integer value from 0 to
                    1000, the common values are as follows:
 
                    Value   Meaning
 
                    400     Normal
 
                    700     Bold
 
                    These values are approximate; the actual appearance
                    depends on the typeface. If &lt;nWeight&gt; is 0, a default
                    weight is used.
 
  &lt;bItalic&gt;         Specifies whether the font is italic.
 
  &lt;bUnderline&gt;      Specifies whether the font is underlined.
 
  &lt;cStrikeOut&gt;      Specifies whether characters in the font are struck
                    out. Specifies a strikeout font if set to a nonzero
                    value.
 
  &lt;nCharSet&gt;        Specifies the font's character set. The following
                    values are predefined:
 
                        ANSI_CHARSET
                        OEM_CHARSET
                        SYMBOL_CHARSET
 
                    The OEM character set is system-dependent.
 
                    Fonts with other character sets may exist in the
                    system. An application that uses a font with an
                    unknown character set must not attempt to translate or
                    interpret strings that are to be rendered with that
                    font. Instead, the strings should be passed directly
                    to the output device driver.
 
  &lt;nOutPrecision&gt;   Specifies the desired output precision. The output
                    precision defines how closely the output must match
                    the requested font's height, width, character
                    orientation, escapement, and pitch. It can be any one
                    of the following values:
 
                        OUT_CHARACTER_PRECIS
                        OUT_DEFAULT_PRECIS
                        OUT_STRING_PRECIS
                        OUT_STROKE_PRECIS
 
  &lt;nClipPrecision&gt;  Specifies the desired clipping precision. The clipping
                    precision defines how to clip characters that are
                    partially outside the clipping region. It can be any
                    one of the following values:
 
                        CLIP_CHARACTER_PRECIS
                        CLIP_DEFAULT_PRECIS
                        CLIP_STROKE_PRECIS
 
  &lt;nQuality&gt;        Specifies the font's output quality, which defines how
                    carefully GDI must attempt to match the logical-font
                    attributes to those of an actual physical font. It can
                    be one of the following values:
 
                    Value             Meaning
 
                    DEFAULT_QUALITY   Appearance of the font does not
                                      matter.
 
                    DRAFT_QUALITY     Appearance of the font is less
                                      important than when PROOF_QUALITY is
                                      used. For GDI raster fonts, scaling
                                      is enabled. Bold, italic, underline,
                                      and strikeout fonts are synthesized
                                      if necessary.
 
                    PROOF_QUALITY     Character quality of the font is
                                      more important than exact matching
                                      of the logical-font attributes. For
                                      GDI raster fonts, scaling is
                                      disabled and the font closest in
                                      size is chosen. Bold, italic,
                                      underline, and strikeout fonts are
                                      synthesized if necessary.
 
  &lt;nPitchAndFamily&gt; Specifies the pitch and family of the font. The two
                    low-order bits specify the pitch of the font and can
                    be any one of the following values:
 
                        DEFAULT_PITCH
                        FIXED_PITCH
                        VARIABLE_PITCH
 
                    The four high-order bits of the member specify the
                    font family and can be one of the following values:
 
                    Value           Meaning
 
                    FF_DECORATIVE   Novelty fonts. Old English, for
                                    example.
 
                    FF_DONTCARE     Don't care or don't know.
 
                    FF_MODERN       Fonts with constant stroke width
                                    (fixed-pitch), with or without serifs.
                                    Fixed-pitch fonts are usually modern.
                                    Pica, Elite, and Courier New are
                                    examples.
 
                    FF_ROMAN        Fonts with variable stroke width
                                    (proportionally spaced) and with
                                    serifs. Times New Roman and Century
                                    Schoolbook are examples.
 
                    FF_SCRIPT       Fonts designed to look like
                                    handwriting. Script and Cursive are
                                    examples.
 
                    FF_SWISS        Fonts with variable stroke width
                                    (proportionally spaced) and without
                                    serifs. MS Sans Serif is an example.
 
                    An application can specify a value for
                    &lt;nPitchAndFamily&gt; by using the Boolean OR operator to
                    join a pitch constant with a family constant.
 
                    Font families describe the look of a font in a general
                    way. They are intended for specifying fonts when the
                    exact typeface desired is not available.
 
  &lt;lpFacename&gt;      A CString or pointer to a null-terminated string that
                    specifies the typeface name of the font. The length of
                    this string must not exceed 30 characters. The Windows
                    EnumFonts function can be used to enumerate all
                    currently available fonts. If &lt;lpFacename&gt; is NULL,
                    GDI uses a default typeface.
 
  Remarks
 
  Initializes a CFont object with the specified characteristics. The font
  can subsequently be selected as the font for any device context.
 
  The CreateFont function does not create a new Windows GDI font. It
  merely selects the closest match from the fonts available in GDI's pool
  of physical fonts.
 
  Return Value
 
  TRUE if successful; otherwise FALSE.

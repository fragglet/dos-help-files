  Style                   Description
 
  CBS_AUTOHSCROLL         Automatically scrolls the text in the edit
                          control to the right when the user types a
                          character at the end of the line. If this style
                          is not set, only text which fits within the
                          rectangular boundary is allowed.
 
  CBS_DROPDOWN            Similar to CBS_SIMPLE, except that the list box
                          is not displayed unless the user selects an icon
                          next to the selection field.
 
  CBS_DROPDOWNLIST        Similar to CBS_DROPDOWN, except that the edit
                          control is replaced by a static text item which
                          displays the current selection in the list box.
 
  CBS_HASSTRINGS          An owner-draw combo box contains items
                          consisting of strings. The combo box maintains
                          the memory and pointers for the strings so the
                          application can use the GetText member function
                          to retrieve the text for a particular item.
 
  CBS_OEMCONVERT          Text entered in the combo box edit control is
                          converted from the ANSI character set to the OEM
                          character set and then back to ANSI. This
                          ensures proper character conversion when the
                          application calls the AnsiToOem member function
                          to convert an ANSI string in the combo box to
                          OEM characters. This style is most useful for
                          combo boxes that contain filenames and applies
                          only to combo boxes created with the CBS_SIMPLE
                          or CBS_DROPDOWN styles.
 
  CBS_OWNERDRAWFIXED      The owner of the list box is responsible for
                          drawing its contents; the items in the list box
                          are all the same height.
 
  CBS_OWNERDRAWVARIABLE   The owner of the list box is responsible for
                          drawing its contents; the items in the list box
                          are variable in height.
 
  CBS_SIMPLE              The list box is displayed at all times. The
                          current selection in the list box is displayed
                          in the edit control.
 
  CBS_SORT                Automatically sorts strings entered into the
                          list box.

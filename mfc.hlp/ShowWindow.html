  BOOL ShowWindow( int nCmdShow );
 
  Parameter   Description
 
  &lt;nCmdShow&gt;  Specifies how the CWnd is to be shown. It must be one of the
              following values:
 
              Value                Meaning
 
              SW_HIDE              Hides CWnd and passes activation to
                                   another window.
 
              SW_MINIMIZE          Minimizes CWnd and activates the
                                   top-level window in the window
                                   manager's list.
 
              SW_RESTORE           Same as SW_SHOWNORMAL.
 
              SW_SHOW              Activates CWnd and displays it in its
                                   current size and position.
 
              SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED     Activates CWnd and displays it as a
                                   maximized window.
 
              SW_SHOWMINIMIZED     Activates CWnd and displays it as a
                                   minimized (iconic) window.
 
              SW_SHOWMINNOACTIVE   Displays CWnd as minimized (iconic)
                                   window. The window that is currently
                                   active remains active.
 
              SW_SHOWNA            Displays CWnd in its current state. The
                                   window that is currently active remains
                                   active.
 
              SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE    Displays CWnd in its most recent size
                                   and position. The window that is
                                   currently active remains active.
 
              SW_SHOWNORMAL        Activates and displays CWnd. If CWnd is
                                   minimized or maximized, Windows
                                   restores it to its original size and
                                   position.
 
  Remarks
 
  Displays or removes the CWnd, as specified by &lt;nCmdShow&gt;.
 
  ShowWindow must be called only once per program with
  CWinApp::m_nCmdShow. Subsequent calls to ShowWindow must use one of the
  values listed above, instead of the one specified by m_nCmdShow.
 
  Return Value
 
  Specifies the previous state of the CWnd. It is TRUE if the CWnd was
  previously visible; FALSE if the CWnd was previously hidden.

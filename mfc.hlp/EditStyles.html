    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

  Style            Meaning
 
  ES_AUTOHSCROLL   Automatically scrolls text to the right by 10
                   characters when the user types a character at the end
                   of the line. When the user presses the ENTER key, the
                   control scrolls all text back to position zero.
 
  ES_AUTOVSCROLL   Automatically scrolls text up one page when the user
                   presses ENTER  on the last line.
 
  ES_CENTER        Centers text in a multiline edit control.
 
  ES_LEFT          Aligns text flush-left.
 
  ES_LOWERCASE     Converts all characters to lowercase as they are typed
                   into the edit control.
 
  ES_MULTILINE     Designates multiple-line edit control. (The default is
                   single-line.) If the ES_AUTOVSCROLL style is specified,
                   the edit control shows as many lines as possible and
                   scrolls vertically when the user presses the ENTER key.
                   If ES_AUTOVSCROLL is not given, the edit control shows
                   as many lines as possible and beeps if ENTER is pressed
                   when no more lines can be displayed.
 
                   If the ES_AUTOHSCROLL style is specified, the
                   multiple-line edit control automatically scrolls
                   horizontally when the caret goes past the right edge of
                   the control. To start a new line, the user must press
                   ENTER. If ES_AUTOHSCROLL is not given, the control
                   automatically wraps words to the beginning of the next
                   line when necessary; a new line is also started if
                   ENTER is pressed. The position of the wordwrap is
                   determined by the window size. If the window size
                   changes, the wordwrap position changes, and the text is
                   redisplayed.
 
                   Multiple-line edit controls can have scroll bars. An
                   edit control with scroll bars processes its own
                   scroll-bar messages. Edit controls without scroll bars
                   scroll as described above, and process any scroll
                   messages sent by the parent window.
 
  ES_NOHIDESEL     Normally, an edit control hides the selection when the
                   control loses the input focus, and inverts the
                   selection when the control receives the input focus.
                   Specifying ES_NOHIDESEL deletes this default action.
 
  ES_OEMCONVERT    Text entered in the edit control is converted from the
                   ANSI character set to the OEM character set and then
                   back to ANSI. This ensures proper character conversion
                   when the application calls the AnsiToOem member
                   function to convert an ANSI string in the edit control
                   to OEM characters. This style is most useful for edit
                   controls that contain filenames.
 
  ES_PASSWORD      Displays all characters as an asterisk (*) as they are
                   typed into the edit control. An application can use the
                   SetPassWordChar member function to change the character
                   that is displayed.
 
  ES_RIGHT         Aligns text flush-right in a multiline edit control.
 
  ES_UPPERCASE     Converts all characters to uppercase as they are typed
                   into the edit control.

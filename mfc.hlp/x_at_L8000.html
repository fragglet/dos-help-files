    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

  Value                Meaning
 
  BS_AUTOCHECKBOX      Same as a check box, except that an X appears in
                       the check box when the user selects the box; the X
                       disappears the next time the user selects the box.
 
  BS_AUTORADIOBUTTON   Same as a radio button, except that when the user
                       selects it, the button automatically highlights
                       itself and removes the selection from any other
                       auto-radio buttons in the same group.
 
  BS_AUTO3STATE        Same as a three-state check box, except that the
                       box changes its state when the user selects it. The
                       state cycles through checked, grayed, and normal.
 
  BS_CHECKBOX          Creates a small square that has text displayed to
                       its right (unless this style is combined with the
                       BS_LEFTTEXT style).
 
  BS_DEFPUSHBUTTON     Creates a button that has a heavy black border. The
                       user can select this button by pressing the ENTER
                       key. This style is useful for enabling the user to
                       quickly select the most likely option (the default
                       option).
 
  BS_GROUPBOX          Creates a rectangle in which other buttons can be
                       grouped. Any text associated with this style is
                       displayed in the rectangle's upper-left corner.
 
  BS_LEFTTEXT          When combined with a radio-button or check-box
                       style, the text appears on the left side of the
                       radio button or check box.
 
  BS_OWNERDRAW         Creates an owner-draw button. The parent window is
                       notified when the button is clicked. Notification
                       includes a request to paint, invert, and disable
                       the button.
 
  BS_PUSHBUTTON        Creates a push button that posts a WM_COMMAND
                       message to the owner window when the user selects
                       the button.
 
  BS_RADIOBUTTON       Creates a small circle that has text displayed to
                       its right (unless this style is combined with the
                       BS_LEFTTEXT style). Radio buttons are usually used
                       in groups of related but mutually exclusive
                       choices.
 
  BS_3STATE            Same as a check box, except that the box can be
                       grayed as well as checked. The grayed state
                       typically is used to show that a check box has been
                       disabled.

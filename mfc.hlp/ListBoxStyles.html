  Style                   Meaning
 
  LBS_EXTENDEDSEL         The user can select multiple items using the
                          SHIFT key and the mouse or special key
                          combinations.
 
  LBS_HASSTRINGS          Specifies an owner-draw list box which contains
                          items consisting of strings. The list box
                          maintains the memory and pointers for the
                          strings so the application can use the GetText
                          member function to retrieve the text for a
                          particular item.
 
  LBS_MULTICOLUMN         Specifies a multicolumn list box that is
                          scrolled horizontally. The SetColumnWidth member
                          function sets the width of the columns.
 
  LBS_MULTIPLESEL         String selection is toggled each time the user
                          clicks or double-clicks the string. Any number
                          of strings can be selected.
 
  LBS_NOINTEGRALHEIGHT    The size of the list box is exactly the size
                          specified by the application when it created the
                          list box. Normally, Windows sizes a list box so
                          that the list box does not display partial
                          items.
 
  LBS_NOREDRAW            List-box display is not updated when changes are
                          made. This style can be changed at any time by
                          sending a WM_SETREDRAW message.
 
  LBS_NOTIFY              Parent window receives an input message whenever
                          the user clicks or double-clicks a string.
 
  LBS_OWNERDRAWFIXED      The owner of the list box is responsible for
                          drawing its contents; the items in the list box
                          are the same height.
 
  LBS_OWNERDRAWVARIABLE   The owner of the list box is responsible for
                          drawing its contents; the items in the list box
                          are variable in height.
 
  LBS_SORT                Strings in the list box are sorted
                          alphabetically.
 
  LBS_STANDARD            Strings in the list box are sorted
                          alphabetically and the parent window receives an
                          input message whenever the user clicks or
                          double-clicks a string. The list box contains
                          borders on all sides.
 
  LBS_USETABSTOPS         Allows a list box to recognize and expand tab
                          characters when drawing its strings. The default
                          tab positions are 32 dialog units. (A dialog
                          unit is a horizontal or vertical distance. One
                          horizontal dialog unit is equal to 1/4 of the
                          current dialog base width unit. The dialog base
                          units are computed based on the height and width
                          of the current system font. The
                          GetDialogBaseUnits member function returns the
                          current dialog base units in pixels.)
 
  LBS_WANTKEYBOARDINPUT   The owner of the list box receives WM_VKEYTOITEM
                          or WM_CHARTOITEM messages whenever the user
                          presses a key when the list box has input focus.
                          This allows an application to perform special
                          processing on the keyboard input.

  Style               Meaning
 
  DS_LOCALEDIT        Specifies that edit controls in the dialog box will
                      use memory in the application's data segment. By
                      default, all edit controls in dialog boxes use
                      memory outside the application's data segment. This
                      feature may be suppressed by adding the DS_LOCALEDIT
                      flag to the STYLE command for the dialog box. If
                      this flag is not used, EM_GETHANDLE and EM_SETHANDLE
                      messages must not be used since the storage for the
                      control is not in the application's data segment.
                      This feature does not affect edit controls created
                      outside of dialog boxes.
 
  DS_MODALFRAME       Creates a dialog box with a modal dialog-box frame
                      that can be combined with a title bar and System
                      menu by specifying the WS_CAPTION and WS_SYSMENU
                      styles.
 
  DS_NOIDLEMSG        Suppresses WM_ENTERIDLE messages that windows would
                      otherwise send to the owner of the dialog box while
                      the dialog box is displayed.
 
  DS_SYSMODAL         Creates a system-modal dialog box.
 
  WS_BORDER           Creates a window that has a border.
 
  WS_CAPTION          Creates a window that has a title bar (implies the
                      WS_BORDER style). This style cannot be used with the
                      WS_DLGFRAME style.
 
  WS_CHILD            Creates a child window. Cannot be used with the
                      WS_POPUP style.
 
  WS_CHILDEDIT        Same as the WS_CHILD style.
 
  WS_CLIPCHILDREN     Excludes the area occupied by child windows when
                      drawing within the parent window. Used when creating
                      the parent window.
 
  WS_CLIPSIBLINGS     Clips child windows relative to each other; that is,
                      when a particular child window receives a paint
                      message, the WS_CLIPSIBLINGS style clips all other
                      overlapped child windows out of the region of the
                      child window to be updated. (If WS_CLIPSIBLINGS is
                      not given and child windows overlap, it is possible,
                      when drawing within the client area of a child
                      window, to draw within the client area of a
                      neighboring child window.) For use with the WS_CHILD
                      style only.
 
  WS_DISABLED         Creates a window that is initially disabled.
 
  WS_DLGFRAME         Creates a window with a double border but no title.
 
  WS_GROUP            Specifies the first control of a group of controls
                      in which the user can move from one control to the
                      next by using the DIRECTION keys. All controls
                      defined with the WS_GROUP style after the first
                      control belong to the same group. The next control
                      with the WS_GROUP style ends the style group and
                      starts the next group (that is, one group ends where
                      the next begins). Only dialog boxes use this style.
 
  WS_HSCROLL          Creates a window that has a horizontal scroll bar.
 
  WS_ICONIC           Same as the WS_MINIMIZE style.
 
  WS_MAXIMIZE         Creates a window of maximum size.
 
  WS_MAXIMIZEBOX      Creates a window that has a maximize box.
 
  WS_MINIMIZE         Creates a window that is initially minimized. For
                      use with the WS_OVERLAPPED style only.
 
  WS_MINIMIZEBOX      Creates a window that has a minimize box.
 
  WS_OVERLAPPED       Creates an overlapped window. An overlapped window
                      has a caption and a border.
 
  WS_OVERLAPPEDEDIT   Creates an overlapped window having the
                      WS_OVERLAPPED, WS_CAPTION, WS_SYSMENU,
                      WS_THICKFRAME, WS_MINIMIZEBOX, and WS_MAXIMIZEBOX
                      styles.
 
  WS_POPUP            Creates a pop-up window. Cannot be used with the
                      WS_CHILD style.
 
  WS_POPUPEDIT        Creates a pop-up window that has the WS_BORDER,
                      WS_POPUP, and WS_SYSMENU styles. The WS_CAPTION
                      style must be combined with the WS_POPUPEDIT style
                      to make the system menu visible.
 
  WS_SIZEBOX          Same as the WS_THICKFRAME style.
 
  WS_SYSMENU          Creates a window that has a System-menu box in its
                      title bar. Used only for windows with title bars.
 
  WS_TABSTOP          Specifies one of any number of controls through
                      which the user can move by using the TAB key. The
                      TAB key moves the user to the next control specified
                      by the WS_TABSTOP style. Only dialog boxes use this
                      style.
 
  WS_THICKFRAME       Creates a window with a thick frame that can be used
                      to size the window.
 
  WS_TILED            Same as the WS_OVERLAPPED style.
 
  WS_TILEDEDIT        Same as the WS_OVERLAPPEDEDIT style.
 
  WS_VISIBLE          Creates a window that is initially visible. This
                      applies to overlapped and pop-up windows. For
                      overlapped windows, the &lt;Y&gt; parameter is used as a
                      ShowWindow function parameter.
 
  WS_VSCROLL          Creates a window that has a vertical scroll bar.

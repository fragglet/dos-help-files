  Style               Meaning
 
  SS_BLACKFRAME       Specifies a box with a frame drawn with the same
                      color as window frames. This color is black in the
                      default Windows color scheme.
 
  SS_BLACKRECT        Specifies a rectangle filled with the color used to
                      draw window frames. This color is black in the
                      default Windows color scheme.
 
  SS_CENTER           Designates a simple rectangle and displays the given
                      text centered in the rectangle. The text is
                      formatted before it is displayed. Words that would
                      extend past the end of a line are automatically
                      wrapped to the beginning of the next centered line.
 
  SS_GRAYFRAME        Specifies a box with a frame drawn with the same
                      color as the screen background (desktop). This color
                      is gray in the default Windows color scheme.
 
  SS_GRAYRECT         Specifies a rectangle filled with the color used to
                      fill the screen background. This color is gray in
                      the default Windows color scheme.
 
  SS_ICON             Designates an icon displayed in the dialog box. The
                      given text is the name of an icon (not a filename)
                      defined elsewhere in the resource file. The &lt;nWidth&gt;
                      and &lt;nHeight&gt; parameters are ignored; the icon
                      automatically sizes itself.
 
  SS_LEFT             Designates a simple rectangle and displays the given
                      text flush-left in the rectangle. The text is
                      formatted before it is displayed. Words that would
                      extend past the end of a line are automatically
                      wrapped to the beginning of the next flush-left
                      line.
 
  SS_LEFTNOWORDWRAP   Designates a simple rectangle and displays the given
                      text flush-left in the rectangle. Tabs are expanded,
                      but words are not wrapped. Text that extends past
                      the end of a line is clipped.
 
  SS_NOPREFIX         Unless this style is specified, windows will
                      interpret any &amp; characters in the control's text to
                      be accelerator prefix characters. In this case, the
                      &amp; is removed and the next character in the string is
                      underlined. If a static control is to contain text
                      where this feature is not wanted, SS_NOPREFIX may be
                      added. This static-control style may be included
                      with any of the defined static controls.
 
                      You can combine SS_NOPREFIX with other styles by
                      using the bitwise OR operator. This is most often
                      used when filenames or other strings that may
                      contain an &amp; need to be displayed in a static
                      control in a dialog box.
 
  SS_RIGHT            Designates a simple rectangle and displays the given
                      text flush-right in the rectangle. The text is
                      formatted before it is displayed. Words that would
                      extend past the end of a line are automatically
                      wrapped to the beginning of the next flush-right
                      line.
 
  SS_SIMPLE           Designates a simple rectangle and displays a single
                      line of text flush-left in the rectangle. The line
                      of text cannot be shortened or altered in any way.
                      (The control's parent window or dialog box must not
                      process the WM_CTLCOLOR message.)
 
  SS_USERITEM         Specifies a user-defined item.
 
  SS_WHITEFRAME       Specifies a box with a frame drawn with the same
                      color as window backgrounds. This color is white in
                      the default Windows color scheme.
 
  SS_WHITERECT        Specifies a rectangle filled with the color used to
                      fill window backgrounds. This color is white in the
                      default Windows color scheme.

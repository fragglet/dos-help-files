<pre> 
     Cannot write to PRN
 
     A request was made to print to the PRN port, but PWB cannot access
     the printer.
 
     Check that the printer is turned on and is ready to print. Also,
     make sure that the PRN port is defined and connected to the
     printer.
 
     If your printer is connected to a port other than PRN (COM1 or
     LPT1, for example), change the Printcmd switch to copy the file to
     the appropriate port.

     Build Information has changed.
     Do you want to rebuild everything?
 
     A request was made to perform a build operation for the project,
     and the build information for the current project has changed
     since the last build. PWB is asking for confirmation to rebuild
     all files in the project.
 
     The build information can be changed, for example, by altering an
     option in an Options menu, Language Options dialog box or by
     setting a new project template.
 
     Response    Action
 
     Y (yes)     Rebuild all files in the project.
 
     N (no)      Build only the specified target ('all' is a target).
                 Only those files that are out-of-date with respect to
                 the target are built.
 
                 WARNING: This may cause your project to be built in an
                          inconsistent state. Unpredictable results may
                          occur.

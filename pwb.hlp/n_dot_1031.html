     Do you want to delete this file from the active window?
 
     A request was made to remove the current file from the window by
     using the Arg Refresh function sequence. PWB is prompting for
     confirmation.
 
     Response    Action
 
     Y (yes)     Clear the file from the window. You lose any changes
                 made since the file was last saved. If no more files
                 remain in the window's file history, the window is
                 closed.
 
     N (no)      Do not clear the file. A No response cancels the
                 operation and returns you to normal editing.

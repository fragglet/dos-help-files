     Unknown function &lt;name&gt;
 
     The function or macro &lt;name&gt; was used in a macro, but it is not
     currently defined.
 
     Try the following possible remedial actions:
 
       ■  Check the spelling of the name.
 
       ■  If &lt;name&gt; is the name of a macro, check that the macro is
          defined.
 
       ■  If &lt;name&gt; is the name of an extension function (Pwbrowsenext
          or Pwbhelp, for example) check that the extension is loaded.

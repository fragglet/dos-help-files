     Boolean switch style conflict
 
     A request was made to set a switch, combining two mutually
     exclusive styles for setting Boolean switches.
 
     This can happen, for example, if you write the switch setting
     "noEnterinsmode:no". This setting is correctly written as
     either "noEnterinsmode:" or "Enterinsmode:no".

     To record a macro:
 
       1. Set the name and key for the recorded macro by choosing Set
          Record from the Edit menu.
 
       2. To start recording the macro, choose Record On from the Edit
          menu or execute the Record function («record»).
 
          While macro recording is turned on, the letter X appears in
          the status bar.
 
          You can also start recording with variations:
 
             ■ To set the name of the macro and begin recording in one
               step, execute the function sequence: Arg 'name' Record
               («arg» name «record»).
 
             ■ To record actions without executing them, start recording
               by using a Meta form of the Record function.
 
       3. Execute the series of actions you want to record.
 
          Note that some commands cannot be recorded. These commands
          are unavailable while recording is turned on.
 
       4. Turn recording off by choosing Record On from the Edit menu or
          by executing the Record function again («record»).
 
     To resume recording the macro where you left off, turn off the
     Clear First check box in the Set Macro Record dialog box, or start
     recording by using an Arg Arg form of the Record function.
 
     You can open the Record window to view, edit, and save the current
     recorded macro.

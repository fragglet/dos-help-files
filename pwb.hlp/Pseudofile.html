    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

     Pseudofile
 
     A PWB file that exists only in internal PWB memory; it does not
     correspond to any disk file. When the active window contains a
     pseudofile, the letter 'P' appears on the status bar. The filename
     for a pseudofile has a special form.
     See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='ps_dot_name.html'>Pseudofile Naming Convention</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
     The Untitled.nnn files created by the New command on the File
     menu or the Newfile function («newfile») are special examples of
     pseudofiles.
     See: Newfile, <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='m_dot_F_dot_N.html'>File menu, New</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
     PWB has several predefined pseudofiles (such as the clipboard)
     that you usually open with the commands listed in the PWB Windows
     cascaded menu. PWB has additional pseudofiles that are not listed
     which it uses to maintain temporary information needed during a
     PWB session. These pseudofiles can be opened by name using the
     Open command on the File menu and the Openfile and Setfile
     functions.
     See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='x_at_L803e.html'>List of PWB Pseudofiles</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
     You must always save a pseudofile explicitly. It is never saved
     during Autosave, Timersave, Saveall, or Save All operations.
     See: Autosave, Timersave, Saveall, <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='m_dot_F_dot_v.html'>File menu, Save All</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
     When you save a pseudofile by using Save As from the File menu or
     by using Arg Arg &lt;file&gt; Setfile or Openfile, PWB does not switch to
     the new file as it does for disk files. Instead, PWB writes a
     "snapshot" of the file to disk and keeps the pseudofile in memory.
     You must explicitly open the new disk file if you want to edit it.
 
     The Untitled.nnn and Record pseudofiles are exceptions. For the
     Untitled.nnn files, PWB switches to the new disk file after the
     save. For Record, PWB saves the recorded macro by modifying
     TOOLS.INI.
 
     Pseudofiles can be used for work space or for temporary data.

     Browser data corrupt or out-of-date.
     Rebuild with current bscmake
 
     A request was made to open a browser database, but the file is not
     recognized as a browser database in the correct format. The file
     may not be a browser database (.BSC file), or it was not built with
     the correct version of the BSCMAKE utility.
 
     Rebuild the database using the BSCMAKE utility that has the same
     version number as the PWBROWSE extension.
 
     BSCMAKE converts previous versions of the .SBR files to the current
     version. Therefore, you do not need to rebuild the .SBR files
     unless you want to change options or you want to take advantage of
     new information that may be placed into .SBR files by the compiler.

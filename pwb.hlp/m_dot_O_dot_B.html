     Choose Browse Options to specify what information is included the
     browser database when it is built. The options you select do not
     take effect until you rebuild the project.
 
     Generate Browse Information
          Turn on to generate browser information (a browser database)
          for the next build of the project. When you turn on this
          option, PWB activates the unavailable options.
 
          Browser information for each module is placed in an .SBR file
          by the compiler, then BSCMAKE combines the .SBR files into a
          single browser database (.BSC file). The database has the same
          base name as the project.
 
          Turn off to suppress building a browser database along with
          the project. The commands to build the database remain in the
          project makefile but are inactive.
 
     Exclude Macro Expanded Symbols  (BSCMAKE /Em)
          Turn on to exclude items used in a macro from the list of
          references for each macro invocation.
 
          When turned off, items in expanded macros are referenced every
          place the macros are used.
 
     Exclude System Include Files  (BSCMAKE /Es)
          Turn on to exclude the information defined and used in system
          include files.
 
          With C and C++, files included by using the angle-bracket
          syntax are considered system include files.
 
     Include Unreferenced Symbols  (BSCMAKE /Iu)
          Turn on to include unreferenced symbols in the database. This
          allows you to find unused items by specifying the Used By
          query in the View Relationship dialog box. You can also use
          the List References command.
          See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='m_dot_B_dot_L.html'>Browse menu, List References</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
               <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='m_dot_B_dot_V.html'>Browse menu, View Relationship</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
          Turn off to generate a smaller database which excludes
          unreferenced symbols and is faster to search and easier to
          query.
 
     Pack .SBR Files
          Turn on to compress .SBR files using the SBRPACK utility,
          which is run by the compiler. SBRPACK removes unreferenced
          items and duplicate information. This option is mutually
          exclusive with the Include Unreferenced Symbols option.
 
     Additional Options
          Type additional BSCMAKE command-line options that are not
          listed in this dialog box.
          See: BSCMAKE
 
     Exclude Files  (BSCMAKE /Ei)
          Choose this button to select files that are to be excluded
          from the database.

     In the TOOLS.INI file, use the backslash to continue a long macro
     definition to the next line. The backslash must be preceded by a
     space to be treated as a line-continuation character.
 
     Precede the backslash by two spaces if you want the concatenated
     macro to contain a space at that location. If the backslash is
     preceded by a tab, PWB treats the tab as if it were two spaces.
 
     The backslash should be the last character on the line except for
     spaces or tabs.
 
     NOTE: The Assign function with no argument does not recognize
           TOOLS.INI line continuations. To initialize a macro defined
           with line continuations, select the entire definition before
           executing Assign («assign»).
           See: Assign
 
     Example
 
     The backslash in the following statement is not a line
     continuation.
 
          Qreplace:CTRL+\
 
     However, the backslash at the end of the first line below is a
     line continuation.
 
          findtag:=Arg Arg "^\\[[^\\]]+\\]" Psearch -&gt;none  \
                   Arg Setwindow =&gt; :&gt;none Arg "no tag" Message
 
     In this example, the backslash is preceded by two spaces. The
     first space is included to separate '-&gt;none' from 'Arg' in the
     concatenated macro definition. The second space identifies the
     backslash that follows it as the line-continuation character.

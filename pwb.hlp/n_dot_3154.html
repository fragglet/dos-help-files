     File type unused by current build options
 
     A file was added to the list of files in the project, but the
     current project template does not contain a rule that tells PWB
     how to handle a file with the extension of the indicated file.
 
     Check that the correct project template is set. The Set Project
     Template dialog box (available when you choose Project Templates
     from the Options menu) displays the current template and allows
     you to set a different one.
 
     Check that the file extension is the standard Microsoft file
     extension for the type of file you are using.

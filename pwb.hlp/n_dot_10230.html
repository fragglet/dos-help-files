     Limit of Global Search Topics has been reached
 
     A request was made to search all open Help files for a text string
     or regular expression, and PWB reached its limit on the number of
     matches it can accommodate in one list. PWB may have run out of
     memory to hold the list.
 
     If the list you have found does not contain the Help you need, try
     a different string or pattern or a more specific one.
 
     To continue searching Help for the same pattern, view Help on the
     last match listed in the global search results then restart the
     global search.
 
     You can also close the Help files you have seen (using the Sethelp
     function) and repeat the search.

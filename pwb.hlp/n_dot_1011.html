    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

     File has been deleted from disk
     &lt;file&gt;
     Discard from memory?
 
     PWB is synchronizing the file in memory with the file on disk and
     has detected that the file on disk has been deleted. PWB is
     prompting for confirmation to discard the file from memory. You
     can choose one of the responses below:
 
     Response   Action
 
     Yes        PWB discards the file. The contents of the file are
                lost and cannot be recovered.
 
     No         PWB retains the file in memory.
 
                To write the file back to disk, choose the Save command
                from the File menu.
 
                To write the file to disk with a different name, choose
                the Save As command from the File menu.
                                    -â™¦-

     User switch too long
 
     The total length of the User switch definition exceeded the
     capacity of PWB's buffer.
 
     The parts of the User switch that are most likely to contribute to
     the excessive length are the mandatory title text, the path
     specification, and the optional helpline text. The path
     specification can be just the base name of the program if the
     program is on the PATH.

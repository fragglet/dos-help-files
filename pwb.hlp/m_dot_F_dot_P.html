     File menu, Print command
 
     Choose Print to print the active file, a selection from the file,
     or several files. With multithreaded environments, PWB runs the
     printing command in the background.
 
     When you choose Print, PWB brings up the File Print dialog box
     with the following options:
 
     File Name
          Type the name of the file to be printed.
 
          By default, PWB places the name of the current file in the
          File Name box. If you select text before you choose Print,
          PWB displays '**selection**' in the File Name box. When you
          choose OK, PWB creates a temporary file for the selected text
          and runs the printing command for that file.
 
     Print Command
          By default, the Print Command text box contains the system-
          level printing command specified by the Printcmd switch. You
          can type a different command or add additional options to the
          default command. If you modify the command, PWB uses the
          modified command for the rest of the session.
 
          If no command has been specified, PWB shows the command as
          '** direct to PRN **', and PWB copies the file to the PRN
          device.
 
          For more information on the syntax for the printing command,
          see Printcmd.
 
     Choose the Files button to print more than one file. When you
     choose Files, PWB displays a dialog box where you can select a
     group of files to be printed. PWB runs the specified command for
     each file on the list.

     When the print operation is complete, PWB saves the redirected
     standard output from the printing command in the Print Results
     window. To view the results, open the Window menu and choose Print
     Results from the PWB Windows cascaded menu.

     TIP: Use the Print command to print example programs or parts of
          Help that interest you.

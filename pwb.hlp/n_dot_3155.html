     PWB understands only a portion of your project makefile
 
     PWB could not understand the project makefile because the file did
     not have the expected format. PWB can continue by reading the
     missing information from a project template.
 
     For example, PWB cannot understand all of a QuickC project makefile.
 
     To provide the missing information, set a project template. Open
     the Project Templates cascaded menu on the Options menu and
     choose the Set Project Template command.

     '&lt;file&gt;': unsupported PWB extension version
 
     The indicated file is recognized as a PWB extension, but it is not
     a supported version.
 
     PWB 1.x extensions are not compatible with PWB 2.00. They are
     refused when you request that they be loaded. Old extensions must
     be recompiled with the new extension support libraries and header
     files. In some cases, recompilation is not sufficient: you must
     modify these extensions for use with PWB 2.00.
 
     Updated Microsoft PWB extensions not included with this product
     are available by contacting Microsoft Product Support Services in
     the United States or your local Microsoft subsidiary. For more
     information, see the Product Assistance Request form, which can be
     found in the back of one of your manuals.

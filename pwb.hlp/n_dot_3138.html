     Cannot rename FILE.$!
 
     PWB was unable to rename the file with the extension '.$'.
 
     To protect against possible errors during the file-saving process,
     PWB saves a file by first saving it as the file FILE.$, then by
     renaming FILE.$.
 
     This file could not be renamed for one of the following reasons:
 
       ■  The file is read-only.
 
       ■  The file is locked by another process. The file or a previous
          copy of FILE.$ may be locked by another process, such as
          CodeView.

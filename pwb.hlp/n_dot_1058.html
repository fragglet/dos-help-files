           The TOOLS.INI file is modified when you save changes in
           the Key Assignments dialog box, Editor Settings dialog
           box, Customize Run menu dialog box, or Record window. A
           mark (.MRK) file is modified when you set or delete a mark
           and a mark file is set.

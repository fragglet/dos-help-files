    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

     NOTE: The TOOLS.INI file and a mark file (if you have set one) can
           be modified indirectly and may be saved by this command.
 
           The TOOLS.INI file is modified when you save changes in
           the Key Assignments dialog box, Editor Settings dialog
           box, Customize Run menu dialog box, or Record window. A
           mark (.MRK) file is modified when you set or delete a mark
           and a mark file is set.

─────Programmer's WorkBench─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
     The Microsoft Programmer's WorkBench is a general, language-
     independent programming platform. The platform includes an editor,
     a build engine that creates and manipulates makefiles, and a
     facility (PWB extensions) to extend the platform. PWB itself has
     no knowledge of specific languages. Extensions support specific
     programming languages, enhance the capabilities of the editor, or
     manage additional tools such as the Microsoft Source Profiler.
 
     Each Microsoft language includes a PWB extension that provides
     support for that language. Each language extension adds a command
     to the Options menu, Language Options cascaded submenu. The Source
     Browser and the Microsoft Advisor are also extensions to the PWB
     platform. Some third-party vendors also provide PWB extensions for
     their programming tools.
     See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='x_at_L801b.html'>PWB Extension Names</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
     To write your own PWB extensions in C, use the headers and
     libraries provided with Microsoft C/C++.
     See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='../ext.hlp/ext_dot_contents.html'>Writing PWB Extensions</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
     PWB extensions are dynamically loaded modules and are not part of
     the PWB executable file. Extensions can be loaded automatically if
     they conform to a naming convention and are in a certain location.
     They can also be loaded explicitly by assigning a new value to the
     Load switch.

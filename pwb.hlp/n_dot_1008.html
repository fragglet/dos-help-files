     File has changed!
 
     PWB produces this message in two situations and prompts for a
     response to one of the following queries:
 
     Query: Save changes?
 
     Cause
 
     A request was made to exit, shell, build, or perform some other
     external operation where PWB checks loaded disk files for
     modification. The file named in the message is modified.
 
     Response    Action
 
     Y (yes)     Write the file to disk.
 
     N (no)      Discard the changes to the file.
 
     «cancel    »Abort the operation.
 
     The TOOLS.INI file is modified when you save changes in the Key
     Assignments dialog box, Editor Settings dialog box, Customize Run
     Menu dialog box, or Record window.
 
     A mark (.MRK) file is modified when you set or delete a mark and a
     mark file is set.
 
     Query: Refresh?
 
     Cause
 
     An operation caused PWB to check the state of the given file on
     disk, and PWB detected that the file on disk has been modified.
     This can happen when another process has modified the file on disk
     since PWB last read or saved the file.
 
     Response    Action
 
     Y (yes)     Reread the file from disk. You lose any changes you made
                 to the file since it was last read or saved.
 
     N (no)      Do not reread the file.
 
                 To save the changes to the file, enter 'N' and then save
                 the modified file. This overwrites any changes made by
                 the other process.
 
     «cancel    »Abort the operation.

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

     Missing ':' in '&lt;text&gt;'
 
     A request was made to perform the assignment specified by the
     given text, but the argument did not contain a colon.
 
     This can happen in the following situations:
 
       ■  In the Editor Settings dialog box, incorrect text was typed in
          the Switch box, and the Set Switch command was chosen.
 
       ■  A PWB section of the TOOLS.INI file contains text that does
          not conform to the syntax for PWB assignments.
 
       ■  A macro definition spans several lines, but a line
          continuation is missing.
 
       ■  The Assign function («assign») was executed when the cursor is
          on a line that does not contain a colon.
 
       ■  If &lt;text&gt; consists of the character '→' (control-z), the
          TOOLS.INI file contains a control-z character which was added
          to the file by using another text editor.
 
          To fix this problem, load TOOLS.INI into PWB and insert a
          non-PWB tag before the control-z character at the end of the
          file. This prevents PWB from attempting to read the character
          as a badly formed assignment. The tag "[end]" is a good
          candidate.

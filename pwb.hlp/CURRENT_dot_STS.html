     PWB and CodeView maintain state information in a file named
     CURRENT.STS, which is saved in the directory listed in the INIT
     environment variable. This file allows information to be saved
     between sessions and shared by PWB and CodeView during the
     session. Information stored in CURRENT.STS includes:
 
       ■  List of open files.
 
       ■  Cursor position in the most recent file.
 
       ■  Window layout.
 
       ■  Strings entered for the last find-and-replace commands.
 
       ■  Name of the last project that was set. Note that the project
          is automatically opened only if you specify /PL on the command
          line or the Lastproject switch is set to Yes.
 
       ■  Current project template, including modified options.
 
       ■  Environment table (optional: controlled by the Envcursave and
          Envprojsave switches).
          See: Envcursave, Envprojsave
 
       ■  CodeView option settings and breakpoints.
 
     Most features of PWB can be set in TOOLS.INI, then modified during
     a PWB session. Some settings, such as the screen height, are saved
     in CURRENT.STS. During each PWB session, these features are set in
     the following order of precedence:
 
       1. Settings explicitly changed during the PWB session
 
       2. Settings in CURRENT.STS (loaded on startup)
 
       3. Settings in TOOLS.INI (loaded on startup)

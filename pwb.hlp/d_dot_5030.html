     The Edit Custom Run Menu Item and Add Custom Run Menu Item dialog
     boxes provide the following options to create and modify custom
     commands in the Run menu:
 
     Option              Description
 
     Menu Text           Specifies the Run menu command name.
 
                         By default, the first letter is the access key
                         for the command. To specify a different access
                         key, place a tilde (~) or ampersand (&amp;) before
                         the access-key character in the title.
 
     Path Name           Specifies the name of the command or path of
                         the program to run.
 
                         If the command is an operating-system command
                         or the program is on the path, you can enter
                         the short name. Otherwise, you must specify
                         the full path.
 
     Arguments           Specifies the default command line for the
                         program. To pass the name of the current file,
                         use the string '%s'.
                         See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='fileparts.html'>Filename-Parts Syntax</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
     Output File Name    Specifies the name of a file that will receive
                         the redirected output from the program.
 
     Initial Directory   Specifies the current directory for the
                         program.
 
     Help Line           Specifies the text that appears on the status
                         bar when the menu command is selected.
 
     You can also specify the following options to control how the
     program is run:
 
     Use Dialog Box for Arguments and Output File
 
          Turn on to prompt for a command line and output file.
 
          Turn off to run the program without prompting.
 
     Prompt Before Returning
 
          Turn on to prompt before returning to PWB. This allows you to
          view program output on the operating-system screen.
 
          Turn off to return to PWB immediately after you run the
          program.
 
     Execute in Background  (multithreaded environments only)
 
          Turn on to run the program in the background.
 
          WARNING: Do not use this option for programs that use the
                   display or expect keyboard input. The program runs,
                   but it does not receive input and may overwrite the
                   PWB display.
 
          Turn off to run the program in the foreground.
 
     Shortcut Key
 
          None      Specifies that the command has no shortcut key.
 
          Alt+F     Specifies an ALT+function-key shortcut for the
                    command. Type the number of the function key
                    (from 1 to 12) in the text box.

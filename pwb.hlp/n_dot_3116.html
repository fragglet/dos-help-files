    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

     Error in project makefile format
 
     PWB is unable to read the project makefile as a PWB makefile.
 
     The file is not a PWB makefile, or it has been altered in such a
     way that PWB cannot recognize it as a PWB makefile.
 
     If you have edited the file or it is a makefile that was not
     created by PWB:
 
        ■ Turn on the Use as a Non-PWB Makefile check box in the
          Open Project dialog box when you open the project.
        OR
        ■ Use the Meta form of the Project function.
                                    -♦-

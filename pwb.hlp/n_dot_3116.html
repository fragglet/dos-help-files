     Error in project makefile format
 
     PWB is unable to read the project makefile as a PWB makefile.
 
     The file is not a PWB makefile, or it has been altered in such a
     way that PWB cannot recognize it as a PWB makefile.
 
     If you have edited the file or it is a makefile that was not
     created by PWB:
 
        ■ Turn on the Use as a Non-PWB Makefile check box in the
          Open Project dialog box when you open the project.
        OR
        ■ Use the Meta form of the Project function.
                                    -♦-

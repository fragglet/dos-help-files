<pre> 
     Cannot find label &lt;label&gt;
 
     While executing a macro, PWB encountered a control-flow directive
     that refers to a label that is not defined in the macro.
 
     The macro that PWB is executing is not written correctly.
 
     One possible cause for this error is an incorrectly formed
     TOOLS.INI line continuation in the macro definition. Make sure
     that each line-continuation character is preceded by two spaces.

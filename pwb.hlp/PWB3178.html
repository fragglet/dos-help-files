     PWB3178: Cannot start: unable to open swapping file
 
     PWB is unable to create its virtual-memory file on disk.
 
     PWB creates this file in the directory pointed to by the TMP
     environment variable. If no TMP environment variable is set,
     PWB creates the file in the current directory.
 
     Check that the disk has at least 2 megabytes free and that the
     directory can be accessed with permissions to create a file. Check
     that the TMP environment variable lists a single existing
     directory.

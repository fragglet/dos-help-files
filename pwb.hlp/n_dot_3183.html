     Current project template will be overwritten
                Proceed with changes?
 
     A request was made to set the project template. The current
     project template, including all current compiler and utility
     options, will be overwritten by the new template.
 
     PWB is asking for confirmation to overwrite all changes to the
     current template. Choose one of the following responses:
 
     Response    Action
 
     Yes         The modified template is overwritten by the selected
                 template.
 
     No          PWB does not set the new template and retains the
                 modified template as the current one.
 
     To save the current template for subsequent use as a template for
     new projects, choose the Save Custom Project Template command from
     the Project Templates cascaded menu on the Options menu.

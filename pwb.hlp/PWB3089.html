<pre> 
     PWB3089: Out of near memory below 640K. Unable to recover.
 
     PWB has run out of memory and cannot recover. This is a fatal PWB
     condition. However, PWB is able to save your files, and you can
     restart PWB to continue.
 
     This can happen when using PWB continuously for a long time.
 
     This can also happen when creating a project with a very large
     number of files or adding files to a large project. To make the
     largest amount of memory available to PWB for creating a very large
     project, load only the PWBUTILS extension and only the language
     extensions you need for the project. Start PWB with the /DS option,
     and create the project before doing any other work.
 
     If the project is too large for PWB to handle as a PWB project,
     you can use a non-PWB makefile for your project.

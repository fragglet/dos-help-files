    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre> 
     Cannot compile
 
     A request was made to begin a build or to execute an external
     command by using Arg Arg &lt;command&gt; Compile, but PWB could not
     start the build or command.
 
     PWB may not have been able to find NMAKE or the specified program.
     Be sure the PATH environment variable points to the directory
     containing NMAKE.EXE.
 
     Another cause is that there may not have been enough free memory,
     file handles, or process identifiers. Close files that do not need
     to be open and stop processes in the system that are not required.

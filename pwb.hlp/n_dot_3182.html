     Not enough near memory below 640K to complete operation
 
     Close some files in PWB and try again. If this fails, make more
     memory available to PWB and try again.
 
     If this fails, your project may be too large for PWB to handle
     with your hardware configuration. Try using the makefile as a
     non-PWB makefile.

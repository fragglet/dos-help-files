     Low on conventional memory below 640K
     while processing help
 
     A request was made to access Help, but there was not enough
     available memory to completely process the request. Another
     possible cause for this error is an invalid Help file. Help
     files that are not generated by the HELPMAKE utility, such as
     Windows help files or those provided with non-Microsoft products,
     will cause this error.
 
     Close some files in PWB and try again.
 
     The PWBHELP extension may be able to recover from this error and
     continue. It may display the text of the requested Help topic, but
     without active hyperlinks.

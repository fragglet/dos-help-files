    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

     Project menu, Edit Project command
 
     PWB displays the Edit Project dialog box when you create a new
     project and when you choose Edit Project. Use this dialog box to
     create and edit the list of component files in the project, called
     the "project file list." The types of files that you can add to
     the file list depend on current project template.
     See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='x_at_L81b6.html'>Project File List</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span> <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='pwb_dot_project.html'>About Projects</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
     Edit Project is available only when a PWB project is open. This
     command is unavailable for non-PWB projects. You must edit a
     non-PWB makefile directly.
 
     The Edit Project dialog box provides the following fields, options,
     and commands:
 
     File Name
          Specifies the name of a file to add to the project file list,
          a directory to change to, or a wildcard to set as a filter
          for the File List box.
 
     File List: &lt;directory&gt;
          Displays a list of files in the current directory that match
          the wildcard specified in the File Name box.
 
     Project: &lt;path&gt;\&lt;project&gt;.MAK
          Displays the list of files in the project.
 
     Command Buttons
 
     Add / Delete      Adds or removes the selected file from the list.
 
                       TIP: Double-click a filename to add or remove it
                            from the list.
 
     To Top of List    Moves the selected file to first on the list.
                       Use this command for projects where the order of
                       files is significant, such as those written in
                       Basic.
 
     Clear List        Removes all files from the list.
 
     Add All           Adds all files shown in the File List box to the
                       project file list. If you have many files to add,
                       this is a convenient way to start the list.
 
     Options
 
     Set Include Dependencies
          Turn on to scan for include-file dependencies in all the
          source files in the list. If an included file is modified,
          only the appropriate source file (the one that included the
          modified file) is rebuilt.
 
     Ignore System Include Files
          Turn on to add dependencies only for include files that are
          not system include files. A system include file is determined
          by the "system" attribute specified in a Build:include rule
          in the project template.
 
          With C, for example, files included by using the angle
          bracket syntax are considered system include files.
          See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='Build_cln_include.html'>Build:include</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
     When you finish editing the file list, choose Save List to scan
     for include dependencies and write the project makefile. To back
     out of the dialog box and cancel your changes, choose Cancel.

     Too many applications. Maximum is &lt;number&gt;
 
     While reading TOOLS.INI, PWB encountered a User switch to add an
     application or operating-system command to the Run menu, but the
     Run menu is full. You can continue using PWB without problems.
     However, some custom Run menu commands are not available.
 
     Delete or comment-out some User switch definitions in TOOLS.INI.

     '&lt;name&gt;' is not an editor switch
 
     A request was made to assign a value to &lt;name&gt;, but &lt;name&gt; is not
     the name of a PWB or extension switch.
 
     This can also happen if you attempt to assign a key to a name that
     is not the name of a PWB or extension function or the name of a
     defined macro.
 
     One cause of this error is attempting to define a macro, but
     specifying only a colon (:) instead of the defining operator
     (:=).

     Unsupported status file version
 
     A request was made to open a project whose status file is an
     unsupported version of a status file, or a CURRENT.STS file was
     found that is an unsupported version.
 
     PWB ignores the contents of the status file and overwrites it
     when you close the project or leave PWB.

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre> 
     Multiple &lt;ext&gt; files - only one is allowed
 
     A request was made to save changes to a project, but more than one
     file with the extension &lt;ext&gt; was added to the list of files in
     the project. The current project template allows only one file
     with the specified extension in the project.
 
     This can happen, for example, if you add more than one module-
     definition (.DEF) file to a project.
 
     Delete the extra file from the list.

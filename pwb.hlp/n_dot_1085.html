     All long lines will be broken
 
     While loading a file, PWB encountered lines longer than 250
     characters. All long lines in the file are broken into lines of
     not more than 250 characters. The line breaks are placed after the
     250th character of each long line.
 
     You may have loaded a binary file. When you load a binary file,
     PWB breaks all long lines and converts each null character (ASCII
     0) to a space.
 
     WARNING: The file is modified, but it is not marked as modified in
              the editor.
 
     PWB does not mark the file as modified so that the file is not
     automatically written to disk if you have set the Autosave switch
     to Yes. This allows you to explicitly save or close the modified
     file.
 
     To close the file without saving the modifications:
 
       ■  Choose File Close immediately.
 
          Because the file is not marked as modified, PWB closes it and
          does not prompt or automatically save it.
 
     You can also use the following method to close the file without
     saving changes, even if you have modified it:
 
       1. Execute Arg Refresh («arg» «refresh»).
 
          PWB prompts:
 
          Do you want to delete this file from the current window?
 
       2. Choose Yes.
 
     TIP: To find lines that may have been broken:
 
            1. Turn on non-UNIX regular expressions by setting the
               Unixre switch to No.
 
            2. Search for lines with exactly 250 characters by using
               the regular expression:
 
                    ^?^250

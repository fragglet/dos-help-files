     '&lt;mark&gt;': Mark not found
 
     A request was made to go to a mark, but the mark was not defined.
 
     You can try the following remedial actions:
 
        ■  Check the spelling of the mark.
 
        ■  Set the mark file that contains the definition of the
           requested mark. PWB does not automatically reset the
           previously set mark file.
 
        ■  Use a search command to find the desired location.

<pre> 
     No-edit file may not be modified
 
     A request was made to modify a file that has the no-edit
     restriction. This may be a file such as a PWB pseudofile in a PWB
     window or a file marked read-only on disk that was loaded while
     the Editreadonly switch was set to No.
 
     The no-edit restriction may have been specified for the PWB
     session by using the /R command-line option when starting PWB.
 
     You can use the Noedit function to toggle the no-edit restriction
     and allow modification of your files. You cannot enable modification
     for PWB pseudofiles.

     Learning to use the Build switch to create a new type of project
     template is like learning a new programming language. You cannot
     expect to read this material and immediately create a new project
     template. You should first experiment by modifying an existing
     template before you try to create a new kind of project template.
 
     Before starting with the Build switch, you must thoroughly
     understand how NMAKE processes a makefile. The rules defined by the
     Build switch constitute an NMAKE "meta-language" where a certain
     rule specifies how to create the corresponding construct in the
     NMAKE language. PWB evaluates and applies Build rules in a manner
     that is similar but not identical to the way that NMAKE evaluates
     the corresponding construct in a makefile.
 
     The PWB project makefile mechanism is not designed to support
     arbitrary makefiles. PWB uses only a subset of NMAKE features and
     creates makefiles with a highly structured and stylized form. It is
     easy to define a project template that creates a makefile that
     works correctly in NMAKE but cannot be opened as a PWB project.
 
     For complex build processes and existing non-PWB projects, it is
     better to use a non-PWB makefile. You can still take advantage of
     many of PWB's project-management features with non-PWB makefiles.
     See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='non-PWB_dot_makefile.html'>Using Non-PWB Makefiles</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
     If you want to add targets or pseudotargets that are not directly
     part of the build process, you can append a special section to the
     end of a PWB makefile. The makefile is still recognized as a PWB
     project makefile, and you can build your additional targets by
     specifying them in the Build Target dialog box or in the NMAKE
     Options dialog box.

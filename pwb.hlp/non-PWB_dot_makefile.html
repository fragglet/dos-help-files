     If you have an existing makefile that was not created by PWB, or
     you have a project that cannot be built by using a PWB makefile,
     you can still use many PWB project-management features. The
     commands that do not apply to non-PWB projects are unavailable and
     appear dimmed on the menus.
 
     Unavailable commands include the Build Options, Project Templates,
     Language Options, and LINK Options commands on the Options menu.
     The Compile File and Edit Project commands on the Project menu are
     also unavailable. PWB cannot generate include-file dependencies for
     non-PWB makefiles. All other PWB commands can be used with non-PWB
     projects.
 
     You can use the Source Browser with a non-PWB project. You must
     create the browser database with the makefile or build it
     separately from the project. Instructions for building a browser
     database can be found in the Advanced PWB Techniques chapter of the
     "Environment and Tools" manual.
     See: BSCMAKE
 
     When the browser database (.BSC file) has the same base name as the
     project makefile and resides in the same directory, the browser
     automatically opens it when you open the project. You can open any
     browser database by choosing Open Custom from the Browse menu.

     To create a project for a non-PWB makefile:
 
       1. From the Project menu, choose Open Project.
 
       2. Turn on the Use as a Non-PWB Makefile check box.
 
       3. Type the name of the makefile in the Project Name box. If the
          makefile does not have a file extension, you must specify the
          trailing period. For example:
 
               MAKEFILE.
 
          You can also choose the makefile in the File List box.
 
       4. Choose OK.
 
     PWB then creates a project status file for the non-PWB project.
     See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='project_dot_sts.html'>Project Status File</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
     For a non-PWB project, PWB does not assume anything about the
     contents of the project makefile. PWB never interprets or modifies
     the contents of a non-PWB makefile and allows you to edit the
     makefile while it is the open project.
 
     The Rebuild, Rebuild All, and Build Target commands work slightly
     differently for non-PWB projects than for PWB projects.

     The status bar occupies the bottom line of the PWB display. It is
     divided into three parts: message area, status, and location.

     The message area usually contains the buttons shown above. You can
     click these buttons to access Help, activate the menu bar, or
     shift the focus from one window to another. When a menu is open,
     PWB displays a short description of the selected command in the
     message area. A macro can display information in the message area
     by using the Message function.
     See: Message
 
     The status area displays the following letters to inform you about
     the editor's state.

     The location (made up of line and column fields) displays the line
     and column location of the cursor in the file. Also, when PWB is
     scanning a file, it displays the line being scanned in the line
     indicator according to the setting of the Noise switch.
     See: Noise
 
     Each element of the status bar has its own color:

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre> 
     File is read-only!
 
     An attempt was made to save a file that is marked read only on
     disk.
 
     Depending on the setting of the Readonly switch, PWB prompts you
     for confirmation to run the Readonly command or to rename the
     file. If you decline to run the Readonly command, PWB gives you
     the opportunity to rename the file.
 
     If you decline all prompts by choosing Cancel, PWB aborts the
     operation and returns to normal editing.
                                    -â™¦-

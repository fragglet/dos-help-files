     File is read-only!
 
     An attempt was made to save a file that is marked read only on
     disk.
 
     Depending on the setting of the Readonly switch, PWB prompts you
     for confirmation to run the Readonly command or to rename the
     file. If you decline to run the Readonly command, PWB gives you
     the opportunity to rename the file.
 
     If you decline all prompts by choosing Cancel, PWB aborts the
     operation and returns to normal editing.

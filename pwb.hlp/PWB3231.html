    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

     PWB3231: Not enough memory below 640K for requested video mode
 
     PWB was unable to allocate enough memory to support the requested
     video mode. The request may be implicit by starting PWB in that
     mode.
 
     Change to a lower-resolution video mode and restart PWB. Note that
     there still may not be enough memory to load PWB and its extensions
     or to operate PWB with a reasonable capacity.
 
     Make more memory available and restart PWB.

     File does not exist!
     &lt;file&gt;
 
     The requested file does not exist.
 
     This situation can occur during a normal file operation if the
     file cannot be found or the name is misspelled. It can also occur
     in the following situations:
 
        ■ The results of a build or search are being viewed, but a file
          listed in the results cannot be found.
 
        ■ The project files are being scanned for dependencies, but an
          include file cannot be found.
 
        ■ An attempt has been made to merge a file that does not exist
          by using the Merge command on the File menu or the Paste
          function.
 
     In some situations, PWB prompts you to create the file:
 
          Create?
 
     Response    Action
 
     Y (yes)     Create the file.
     N (no)      Do not create the file.

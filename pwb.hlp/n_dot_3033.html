    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

     Cannot print
 
     A request was made to print, but PWB encountered an error in
     attempting to start the printing process.
 
     The following conditions are possible causes for this error:
 
       ■  The printer is offline.
       ■  The printer is out of paper.
       ■  The printer is not connected to the computer.
       ■  The proper print driver is not installed.
       ■  A print spooler is being used, but the disk is full.
                                    -♦-

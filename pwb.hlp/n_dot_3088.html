    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre> 
     No TOOLS.INI or no [&lt;tag&gt;] section in TOOLS.INI
 
     A request was made to reinitialize PWB or initialize a tagged
     section of the TOOLS.INI file, but PWB could not find the file or
     the specified tag.
 
     You can receive this error if you started PWB with the/D or /DT
     options (suppress reading of TOOLS.INI), and you execute the
     Initialize function («initialize»).
 
     You can also receive this error under the following conditions:
 
        ■ There is no TOOLS.INI file in the directory pointed to by the
          INIT environment variable.
 
        ■ There is no INIT environment variable and there is no TOOLS.INI
          in the current directory.
 
        ■ The given tagged section of TOOLS.INI cannot be found.

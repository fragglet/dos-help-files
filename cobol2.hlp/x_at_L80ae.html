     Directives in the file must be separated by a space and a directive
     cannot be broken across two lines. The directives are read from the
     file until the end of file is reached or another DIRECTIVES
     directive is encountered.
 
     You can specify more than one directives file in a program by
     either specifying DIRECTIVES "file-name" within a directives file
     or by writing more than one $SET statement at the beginning of
     your program. If you specify the DIRECTIVES directive within a
     directives file, the compiler switches to the new directives file,
     reads all the directives in it, returns to the original directives
     file, and continues to read the directives specified after the
     DIRECTIVES directive. You can nest directives files to any depth.
 
     The directives file is searched for in the current and COBOL
     system directories. If no extension is specified, a file
     extension of .DIR will be added before the search is made. If no
     file is found, the search will be repeated with no extension.

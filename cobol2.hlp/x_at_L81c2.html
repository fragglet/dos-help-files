────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
     This directive only has an effect if your program was compiled with
     either PERFORM-TYPE "OSVS" or PERFORM-TYPE "RM" specified.
 
     If you specified PERFORM-TYPE "OSVS" or PERFORM-TYPE "RM" when
     compiling, PERFORM statements are implemented by having a storage
     area, or bucket, associated with each place in the program that can
     be the end of a PERFORM statement's range. When a PERFORM statement
     is executed the return address is stored in the bucket, and at the
     end of the PERFORM statement's range, the bucket is read to determine
     where control should return to, then cleared.
 
     By default, an EXIT PROGRAM statement clears these buckets, so that
     if the program is reentered, none of the return addresses of the
     previously executed PERFORM statements remain. Specifying
     STICKY-PERFORM stops the buckets from being cleared by an EXIT PROGRAM
     statement. This means that on reentry, the return addresses of all
     previously executed PERFORM statements will remain.
 
     A STOP RUN or CANCEL statement clears the buckets regardless of the
     setting of this directive.

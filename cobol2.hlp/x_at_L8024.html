  Descriptions for all of the Compiler directives appear alphabetically.
  Each description contains the following entries.
 
  Directive:    DIRECTIVE-NAME
 
  Function:     Gives a brief description of the function of
                DIRECTIVE-NAME.
 
  Syntax:
 
     <span class='grhilite'>►</span><span class='grhilite'>►</span>─┬───┬─┬───────DIRECTIVE-NAME─"parameter(s)"┬─<span class='grhilite'>►</span><span class='grhilite'>◄</span>
        └─/─┘ └┬────┬─DIRECTIVE-NAME───────────────┘
               └─NO─┘
 
     The syntax of the compiler directives is shown using diagrams
     called "railroad tracks", in which a directive and its parameters
     are shown joined by lines indicating the order in which they should
     be written. You read these diagrams left-to-right. Each diagram
     starts with <span class='grhilite'>►</span><span class='grhilite'>►</span> and ends with <span class='grhilite'>►</span><span class='grhilite'>◄</span>. Sometimes the track forks to
     show alternatives and then joins up again. The length of a track
     has no significance.
 
     Parameters for directives are shown in quotation marks, although
     parentheses can be used instead, unless otherwise stated. When
     quotation marks are used the parameter can contain spaces, whereas
     no spaces are allowed in a parameter surrounded by parentheses. If
     a parameter is specified after a comma, but the file-name is omitted,
     then the directive must be preceded by a slash (/). Otherwise, the
     directive will incorrectly be assumed to be a file-name.
 
  Paramters:    Lists and describes valid parameter(s), if any, for
                the directive.
 
  Default:      Indicates the directive's default setting
 
  Phase:        Shows whether the directive controls the syntax-check
                or generate phase of the Compiler, or both.
 
  $SET:         Shows whether you can put the dircetive on a $SET
                statement in your source program; "Initial" in this entry
                means it is only allowed on an initial $SET statement.
 
     On the button bar is a button to toggle between Summary and Details.
     The Details describe the parameters fully and give additional
     information. If this is not needed there is no Details topic.
 
     The directives are listed in a 2-level menu, in categories
     according to their purpose. A directive that logically belongs in
     two categories appears in both, so you can find it easily. A
     directive on one menu may be cross-referenced (shown by <span class='grhilite'>◄</span> <span class='grhilite'>►</span>) from
     another menu that lists directives you might want to use it with.
 
     In the menus, a * by a directive means you need an add-on product
     before you can use it. If you use it without the appropriate
     add-on product, the compiler does not give an error message but
     the directive does not have the desired effect.

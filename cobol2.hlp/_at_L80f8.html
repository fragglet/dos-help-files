     This directive is reserved for use with add-on products supplied by
     Micro Focus. Do not change its setting unless you have the add-on
     products. Full details of intermediate code portability are included
     with the relevant Micro Focus add-on products.
 
     NOINTLEVEL causes intermediate code to be created that is suitable
     for execution only in this environment.
 
     INTLEVEL "integer" will create intermediate code that can be executed
     by some versions of Micro Focus products in other environments. For
     portability between environments, the value of integer used for
     compilation must be supported by the Micro Focus product on each
     environment on which you wish to execute the intermediate code.
 
     INTLEVEL "integer" may limit the syntax that can be used in your
     program.

     This directive is reserved for use with add-on products supplied
     by Micro Focus. Do not change its setting unless you have an
     appropriate add-on product. This is not for use with CICS OS/2.
 
     With CICS, if CICS-CPY is also set, the compiler inserts:
 
       COPY "CICS.CPY"
 
     at the beginning of your Linkage Section. If your program has no
     Linkage Section, the compiler inserts one as follows:
 
       LINKAGE SECTION.
       COPY "CICS.CPY".
       01 DFHCOMMAREA  PIC X(n).
 
     where:
 
       CICS.CPY         contains a definition of the CICS EXEC INTERFACE
                        BLOCK and DLI INTERFACE BLOCK compatible with
                        Version 1, Release 6 (or earlier) of CICS.
 
       n                1            -  there is no DFHCOMMAREA
                        other value  -  there is a DFHCOMMAREA.
 
     The Linkage Section item following the DFHCOMMAREA record is
     assumed to contain the BLL cells, each named and with the
     description PIC S9(8) COMP. The BLL cells are matched with the
     corresponding Linkage Section records according to CICS rules.
 
     If the compiler inserts the DFHCOMMAREA record, it is not visible
     during animation or in printer listings. However, the record can
     be queried during animation. If you intend to animate a program
     that uses BLL cells, set this directive on.

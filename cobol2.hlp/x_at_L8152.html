     The possible values of dialect are:
 
      MF      Only the exit point of the innermost PERFORM currently
              being executed will be recognized and its return jump taken.
 
      OSVS    The exit point of any PERFORM statement currently being
              executed will be recognized if reached; the return jump
              taken is the first reached. PERFORM statements with the
              same exit point can be nested to a depth of two (one inner
              and one outer). If they are nested deeper, they will not
              return correctly. The end of a section is regarded as the
              same point as the end of its last paragraph.
 
              PERFORM-TYPE "OSVS" provides compatibilty with the mainframe
              behavior of OS/VS COBOL, DOS/VS COBOL, VS COBOL II and
              COBOL/370.
 
      RM      The exit point of any PERFORM statement currently being
              executed will be recognized if reached; the return jump
              taken is the first reached. PERFORM statements with the
              same exit point cannot be nested; if they are they will
              not return correctly. The end of a section is regarded as
              a separate point from the end of its last paragraph.

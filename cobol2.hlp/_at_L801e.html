  Parameters:
 
     in-file            The file to be rebuilt or reorganized.
 
     out-file           The file to contain the result. The root of the
                        name must be different from that of in-file.
 
     options            One or more of the following options, each
                        preceded by a slash, and optionally separated
                        by spaces:
 
         /e             Prevents duplicate key causing REBUILD to abort.
         /i             Makes REBUILD display information.
         /k             Defines the required key structure (reorg only).
         /n             As /i, but no processing is done (rebuild only).
         /v             Makes REBUILD display a running record count.
         /x             Indicates the key of reference (reorg only).
 
  Notes:
 
     If no output file is specified the utility assumes that an index
     rebuild is required; otherwise it does a reorganization.
 
     A rebuild with no options cannot be done if the key information
     in the index file is corrupt. If the index part (.IDX) of the
     indexed file does not exist, you can completely rebuild it by
     additionally specifying a key structure option. You can replace
     the key structure of an existing indexed file with another
     structure, simply by running REBUILD in this mode with a new key
     specification.
 
 
     See your COBOL System Reference for more details of this command
     line.

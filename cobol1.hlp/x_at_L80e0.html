  Description:
 
     Updates to any shared memory allocated to this function are NOT
     serialized or protected by the Run-Time System; you should use
     semaphores to maintain the integrity of the data.
 
     Non-shared memory is owned by the program that created it, and is
     released when the program is canceled. Shared memory is owned by the
     coru; it is released when the coru is terminated.
 
  Parameters on Entry:
 
     memsize                 The number of bytes of memory to allocate.
 
     flags                   bit 0 (x"01"):
                               Setting this bit to zero means that memory
                               is to be non-shared; setting it to one means
                               that memory is to be shared. The default is
                               non-shared.
                             bit 1 (x"02"):
                               Setting this bit to zero means that the
                               allocated memory is relocatable under the
                               DOS run-time system; setting it to one means
                               that the allocated memory is fixed. This bit
                               has no effect on UNIX or OS/2. The default is
                               relocatable.
 
 
  Parameters on Exit:
 
     mem-pointer             A pointer to the memory returned. mem-pointer
                             must be a 01-level data item.
                                    -♦-

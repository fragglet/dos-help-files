  Description:
 
     The masks in mouse-ptr-shape are bit maps that, applied to a
     screen position, would superimpose the mouse shape upon it. The
     pointer shape is formed by PC_SET_MOUSE_SHAPE by ANDing the
     screen character at the mouse position with char_AND_mask, XORing
     the result with char_XOR_mask, and then displaying the result on
     the screen. The attribute is formed similarly.
 
     To call this routine you must have previously called
     PC_SET_MOUSE_SHAPE with the same mouse-handle. The data item
     reserved-item must be as preserved from that call.

  Parameters on Entry:
 
     mouse-handle            Mouse identifier, obtained by earlier
                             call to CBL_INIT_MOUSE.
 
     reserved-item           Reserved for future use.
 
  Parameters on Exit:
 
     mouse-ptr-shape         The bit maps that would create the
                             pointer's current shape.

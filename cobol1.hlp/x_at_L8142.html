  Description:
 
     This routine can be made to fold to upper case by setting the least
     significant bit (bit 0) of split-join-flag1. If this bit is not set,
     the case will be preserved.
 
     This routine can accept either null-terminated or space-terminated
     strings. Setting the second least significant bit (bit 1) of
     split-join-flag1 results in the routine expecting null-terminated
     strings. If this bit is not set, space-terminated strings are
     expected.
 
     If there are two or more dots in the file-name (not counting
     dots in the device or path-name), the extension returned consists
     of the characters between the last dot and the end of the file-name.
     The basename contains everything up to, but not including, the
     last dot.
 
     To make a distinction between file-names with no extension and
     file-names with spaces extension (that is, basenames whose last
     character is a dot), if the extension is spaces extension-length
     is 1 and extension-offset points to the last dot.

  Parameters on Entry:
 
     param-length            Length of split-join-params in bytes,
                             including the two bytes for param-length. The
                             normal value for param-length is 24.
 
     split-join-flag1        bit 1 - if set, specifies that the file-name
                                     is null-terminated, otherwise it is
                                     space-terminated.
                             bit 0 - if set, specifies that the new strings
                                     will be folded to upper case, otherwise
                                     the original case will be preserved.
 
     split-buf-length        Length of split-buffer.
 
     split-buffer            The string to split.
 
  Parameters on Exit:
 
     split-join-flag2        bit 1 - set if there is a wildcard in the
                                     device
                             bit 0 - set if there is a wildcard in basename
                                     or extension
 
     device-offset           Start of device-name in split-buffer, from
                             one.
 
     device-length           Length of device-name; zero if there is none.
                             This includes any following colon.
 
     basename-offset         Start of basename in split-buffer, from one.
 
     basename-length         Length of basename; zero if there is none.
                             This does not include the following dot.
 
     extension-offset        Start of extension in split-buffer, from one.
 
     extension-length        Length of extension; zero if there is none.
                             This does not include the preceding dot.
 
     total-length            Total number of characters in the string.
 
     first-path-component    Number of characters up to and including the
     -length                 first \ or / or colon; if split-buffer
                             contains none of these, this field =
                             device-length.
 
     split-buffer            Unchanged unless bit 1 of split-join-flag1
                             is set, when it is folded to upper case.
 
     status-code             Return status:
 
                              0 = success
                              4 = illegal file-name

  Description:
 
     The routine sets RETURN-CODE to zero for success, non zero for failure.
     The procedure will be executed whether the application finishes
     normally (with a STOP RUN) or abnormally (with a Ctrl+Break, RTS
     error, etc). You can install several closedown procedures for an
     application by repeated calls of this routine.
 
     A closedown procedure can be written in any language. If it is in
     COBOL, install-address must be the address of an entry point. You can
     obtain this address using the statement:
 
               SET install-address TO ENTRY entry-name
 
     A closedown procedure in COBOL can include any legal COBOL, including
     CALL statements. The closedown procedure will terminate when the main
     program in the procedure does an EXIT PROGRAM/GOBACK or when a STOP RUN
     statement is executed.
 
     A closedown procedure in any other language must preserve the i86
     machine code BP register and direction flag, and terminate with a far
     return (RETF) instruction; that is, it must be a far procedure.
 
  Parameters on Entry:
 
     install-flag            Indicates the operation to be performed:
 
                               0 = install closedown procedure
                               1 = de-install closedown procedure
 
     install-address         Address of closedown procedure.
 
  Parameters on Exit:
 
     None
                                    -♦-

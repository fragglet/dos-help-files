─────Overlay-Manager Prompts────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
     The overlay manager searches for the .EXE file whenever another
     overlay needs to be loaded. It first searches in the current
     directory. If the file is not there, the manager searches the
     directories in the PATH environment variable. If the overlay
     manager cannot find the file, it prompts for the pathname.
 
     Assume that an executable program called PAYROLL.EXE uses overlays
     and does not exist in either the current directory or in the PATH
     directories. If the user runs PAYROLL.EXE by entering a complete
     path specification, the overlay manager displays the following
     message when it attempts to load overlay files:
 
          Cannot find PAYROLL.EXE
          Please enter new program spec:
 
     You can then enter the drive and/or directory where PAYROLL.EXE is
     located. For example, if the file is located in \EMPLOYEE\DATA\
     on drive B, enter B:\EMPLOYEE\DATA\ (or just \EMPLOYEE\DATA\
     if the current drive is B).
 
     If you later remove the disk in drive B and the overlay manager
     needs the overlay again, it displays the following message:
 
          Please insert diskette containing
          B:\EMPLOYEE\DATA\PAYROLL.EXE in drive B:
          and strike any key when ready.
 
     After the overlay file has been read from the disk, the overlay
     manager displays the following message:
 
          Please restore the original diskette.
          Strike any key when ready.

─────LINK Temporary File────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
     LINK uses available memory during the linking session. If LINK
     runs out of memory, it creates a temporary file to hold
     intermediate work. LINK deletes the file when it finishes.
 
     When LINK creates a temporary file, you see the message
 
          Temporary file &lt;tempfile&gt; has been created.
          Do not change diskette in drive &lt;letter&gt;.
 
     In this message, &lt;tempfile&gt; is the name of the temporary file and
     &lt;letter&gt; is the drive identifier where &lt;tempfile&gt; is stored. (The
     second line appears only for a floppy drive.)
 
     After this message appears, do not remove the disk from the drive
     specified by &lt;letter&gt; until the link session ends. If the disk is
     removed, the operation of LINK is unpredictable, and you might see
     the following message:
 
          Unexpected end-of-file on scratch file
 
     If this happens, run LINK again.
 
     Location of the Temporary File
 
        ■ If the TMP environment variable defines a temporary
          directory, LINK stores the temporary file there.
 
        ■ If TMP is undefined or its directory doesn't exist, LINK
          stores the temporary file in the current directory.
 
     Name of the Temporary File
 
        ■ When running under OS/2 or DOS version 3.0 or later, LINK
          asks the operating system to create a temporary file with a
          unique name in the temporary-file directory.
 
        ■ Under DOS versions earlier than 3.0, LINK creates a temporary
          file named VM.TMP. Avoid using this name for your files.

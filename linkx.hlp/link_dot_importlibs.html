─────Import Libraries───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
     Import libraries are created by IMPLIB and are used to link DLLs
     with applications.

     Import libraries are similar to standard libraries, which are
     object-file libraries created by the LIB utility. Import libraries
     and standard libraries are both called static libraries. Both
     kinds of libraries:
 
        ■ Are specified in LINK's &lt;objfiles&gt; and &lt;libraries&gt; fields for
          use by LINK in resolving external references.

        ■ Can be combined using the LIB utility.

     Import libraries differ from standard libraries in that they do
     not contain executable code or data. Instead, they identify the
     DLLs where the executable code or data can be found at run time.
 
     Why Use Import Libraries?
 
     Import libraries are recommended for use with all DLLs for two
     reasons:
 
       1. IMPLIB automates the program-creation process. You supply
          IMPLIB with either the module-definition (.DEF) file
          describing the DLL you want to use or the DLL itself. Without
          an import library, you must create a second .DEF file that
          explicitly defines all needed functions in the DLL.
 
       2. Import libraries make it easier for one person to write a
          DLL and another to write the application. Much of the process
          (linking the DLL and creating the import library) can be done
          by the author of the DLL. The author can the give both the
          import library and the DLL to the person linking the
          application, who does not have to create a .DEF file.

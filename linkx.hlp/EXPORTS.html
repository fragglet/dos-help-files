     Syntax:  EXPORTS
                exportdefinitions
 
     This statement defines the names and attributes of the functions
     and data items made available to other applications and DLLs, and
     of the functions that run with I/O privilege. A definition is
     required for each function or data item being exported.
 
     The EXPORTS keyword marks the beginning of the export definitions,
     each on its own line. EXPORTS must appear once before the first
     definition (on the same or preceding line) and can be repeated
     before each additional definition. EXPORTS statements can appear
     more than once in the file.
 
     Some languages offer a way to export without using an EXPORTS
     statement. For example, in the C language, the _exports keyword
     generates an export description in the object file.
 
     Export-Definition Syntax
 
     entryname [=internalname] [@ord[ RESIDENTNAME]] [NODATA] [pwords]
 
     &lt;entryname&gt;      The function or data-item name as it is known to
                      other applications and DLLs.
 
     &lt;internalname&gt;   The actual name of the exported function or data
                      item as it appears in the exporting application
                      or DLL. The default is &lt;entryname&gt;.
 
     &lt;ord&gt;            The function's ordinal position within the
                      module-definition table as an integer from 1 to
                      65,535. If &lt;ord&gt; is used, the function can be
                      called by either &lt;entryname&gt; or &lt;ord&gt;. Use of
                      ordinal positions is faster and can save space.
 
     RESIDENTNAME     Specifies that &lt;entryname&gt; be kept resident in
                      memory at all times. If &lt;ord&gt; is not used,
                      &lt;entryname&gt; is always kept in memory.
 
     NODATA           Specifies that there is no static data in the
                      function.
 
     &lt;pwords&gt;         Gives the total size of the function's parameters
                      in words. Required only if the function executes
                      with I/O privilege. When a function with I/O
                      privilege is called, OS/2 consults &lt;pwords&gt; to
                      determine how many words to copy from the
                      caller's stack to the function's stack.
 
     Internal and External Names
 
     A given symbol (function or data item) has a name for each of
     three different contexts in two programs (applications or DLLs):
 
        ■ Within the exporting program
 
        ■ As an entry point between programs
 
        ■ Within the importing program where the symbol is used
 
     If neither program uses an internal name, the symbol has the same
     name in all three contexts. If either of the programs uses an
     internal name, the symbol may have more than one distinct name.

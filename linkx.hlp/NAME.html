─────NAME Statement─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
     Syntax:  NAME [appname] [apptype] [NEWFILES]
 
     This statement identifies the executable file as an application.
     It can also specify the name and type. NAME or LIBRARY must
     precede all other statements. If NAME is specified, the LIBRARY
     statement cannot be used. If neither is used, the default is NAME.
     Fields can appear in any order.
 
     If &lt;appname&gt; is specified, it becomes the name of the application
     as it is known by OS/2 or Windows. This name can be any valid
     filename. If &lt;appname&gt; contains a space, begins with a
     nonalphabetic character, or is a reserved word, enclose &lt;appname&gt;
     in double quotation marks. The name cannot exceed 255 characters
     (not including surrounding quotation marks). The default is the
     base name of the executable file.

     If &lt;apptype&gt; is specified, it defines the type of application:

     WINDOWAPI         OS/2 Presentation Manager (PM) or Windows
                       application. The application uses the API
                       provided by PM or Windows and must be executed
                       in the PM or Windows environment. Equivalent to
                       the LINK option /PM:PM.
 
     WINDOWCOMPAT      Character-mode application to run in a text
                       window in the PM or Windows session. Equivalent
                       to the LINK option /PM:VIO.
 
     NOTWINDOWCOMPAT   Default. Character-mode application that must
                       run full screen and cannot run in a text window
                       in PM or Windows. Equivalent to the LINK option
                       /PM:NOVIO.
 
     Specify NEWFILES to tell the operating system that the application
     supports long filenames and extended file attributes, available
     under HPFS (high-performanance file system). The synonym LONGNAMES
     is supported for compatibility.

─────APPLOADER Statement────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
     Syntax:  APPLOADER [']loadername[']
 
     The APPLOADER statement tells LINK to replace the default Windows
     loader with a custom loader. Use APPLOADER when you want your
     Windows program to be loaded by a different loader than the one
     called automatically by Windows at load time. This statement
     applies only to Windows programs.
 
     The &lt;loadername&gt; is an identifier for an externally defined loader
     routine, optionally enclosed in single or double quotation marks
     (' or "). The identifier is an external reference that must be
     resolved at link time in an object file or static library. It is
     not case sensitive unless the /NOI option is used with the linker.
 
     When APPLOADER appears in a module-definition file, LINK sets a
     bit in the header of the executable file to tell Windows that a
     custom loader is present. At load time, Windows loads only the
     first program segment and transfers control to that segment.
 
     LINK creates a new logical segment called LOADER_loadername and
     makes it the first physical segment of the program. LINK places
     the &lt;loadername&gt; routine in this segment. Nothing else is put in
     LOADER_loadername; the /PACKC option does not affect this segment.
 
     Example
 
          APPLOADER __MSLANGLOAD
 
     This statement replaces the default loader with a loader called
     __MSLANGLOAD, which is defined in the Microsoft FORTRAN run-time
     libraries. Windows programs that use huge arrays will fail unless
     loaded by the custom loader provided in the default FORTRAN
     libraries. This statement appears in the default module-definition
     file used for FORTRAN QuickWin programs.

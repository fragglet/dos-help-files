changes you have made to a loaded file since the last the

  ■ Choose &lt;Yes&gt; to save the file, preserving your
    changes, and then finish executing this command.
  ■ Choose &lt;No&gt; to finish executing this command without
    saving the file. Use this choice to throw away work
    that you do not wish to save. Or,

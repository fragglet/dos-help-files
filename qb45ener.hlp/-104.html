<pre>User-defined type identifier and record-element names
cannot contain periods. The period should be used only
as a record-variable separator.
 
In addition, a variable name cannot contain a period
if the part of the name before the period has been
used in an AS clause that defined a user datatype
anywhere in the program.
 
If you have programs that use the period in variable names,
you should change them to mixed case.  For example,
variable ALPHA.BETA would become AlphaBeta.

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>An array element was referenced with a subscript that was
outside the dimensions of the array, or an element of an
undimensioned dynamic array was accessed.
 
You may also get this error if the array size exceeds 64K,
the array is not dynamic, and the /AH option was not used.
Either
  ■ Reduce the size of the array
  ■ Make the array dynamic and re-invoke QuickBASIC using
    the /AH command-line option

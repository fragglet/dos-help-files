QuickBASIC is attempting to load a binary file and does
not recognize the binary-file format. QuickBASIC
recognizes two binary-file formats:
  1. QuickBASIC program files
  2. Help files
This error commonly occurs when QuickBASIC is asked to
use an include file that has been saved in compressed
format. Include files must be saved in text format, so
  1. Reload the include file as a module
  2. Save it in text format
  3. Run the program again.

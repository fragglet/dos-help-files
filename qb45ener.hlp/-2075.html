<pre>
Make sure the file specification you entered in the
text box is formatted correctly.
 
Any file name can contain a full or partial path name.
A full path name starts with the drive name; a partial
path name has one or more directory names before the
file name, but does not include a drive name. For
example,
 
  a:progsgraphiccircle.bas is a valid full path name
  graphiccircle.bas is a valid partial path name
  ..graphiccircle.bas is a valid partial path name
 
This error can also occur when you try to save a file
which replaces an existing read-only file.

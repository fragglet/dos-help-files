<pre>QuickBASIC will not make a Quick library with the same
name as a Quick library already loaded into memory.
Either
  ■ Enter a different name in the text box for the new
    Quick Library to include the contents of the loaded
    library in the new one you are building, or
  ■ Re-invoke QuickBASIC from the DOS command line without
    using the /L option. This lets you make a Quick library
    that does not include a previously made one.

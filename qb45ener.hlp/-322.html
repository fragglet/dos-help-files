This command toggles a QuickBASIC Smart Editor function on
and off.
 
As you enter each line, the Smart Editor
  1. Checks the line for syntax errors
  2. Formats the line
  3. Translates the line to executable form if the syntax
     is correct
 
Turn off the Syntax Checking to suppress the first of these
functions to enter program code for debugging later.
 
When Syntax Checking is on, a bullet will appear to the left
of the command.
 
These commands from the File Menu turn Smart Editor features
on while they execute:
  ■ New Program or Open Program
  ■ Create File or Load File (unless you select the Document
    option).
 
If you select the Document option with Create File or Load
File, the editor will be turned off.

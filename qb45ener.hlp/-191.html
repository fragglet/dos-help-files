    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>Include file text is displayed in the View window along
with program text. If you want to edit the program, you
must remove the include file from the View window.
  â–  Choose &lt;OK&gt; to remove the read-only include file from
    the View window so you can start editing program text.
    The Include Lines command will also be turned off.

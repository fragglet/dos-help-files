<div class="page-title"> Modified INCLUDE File Prompt</div>
<pre>When QuickBASIC runs a program that references include
files through $INCLUDE metacommands, QuickBASIC can only
use the versions of those include files that are on disk.
 
There are one or more include files loaded into memory
that have not been saved to disk since they were modified.
QuickBASIC needs to know which version of the include files
you want to run. Either,
  ■ Choose &lt;Yes&gt; to save the modified include files and
    run.
  ■ Choose &lt;No&gt; to run the program with the versions that
    are currently on disk (the unmodified versions). Or,
  ■ Choose &lt;Cancel&gt; if you don't want to run the program.

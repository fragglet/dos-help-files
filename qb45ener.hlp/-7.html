<pre>More memory was required than is available. For example,
there may not be enough memory to allocate a file buffer.
 
In DOS
  ■ Reduce the size of your DOS buffers
  ■ Eliminate any terminate-and-stay resident programs
  ■ Eliminate some device drivers
In QuickBASIC
  ■ Try placing a $DYNAMIC metacommand at the top of your
    program if you have large arrays
  ■ Unload any document or source files that are in memory
    but not needed
  ■ Make your programs smaller
  ■ Try to put your routines into a Quick library

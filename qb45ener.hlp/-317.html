    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<div class="page-title"> Break On Errors Command (Full Menus Only)</div>
<pre>Use this command when debugging a program that contains
an error-handling procedure.
 
Break On Errors (toggled on when a bullet appears next
to the command) causes your program to stop at the first
statement in the most recently executed error-handling
subroutine. This suspends program execution so you can
locate the error's source.
 
Turning on Break On Errors also enables the History On
toggle, so the 20 statements executed just before the
breakpoint are also recorded. Use the SHIFT+F8 key once to
back up to the statement that caused the error. Backing up
further will show you the statements that lead to the error.

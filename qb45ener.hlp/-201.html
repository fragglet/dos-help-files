<pre>During debugging, you used the Next Statement command to
specify a statement that is in a procedure other than
the one where program execution is suspended. QuickBASIC
ignores the Next Statement command.
 
Move the suspended procedure into the View window and, if
you still want to use a Next Statement command, use it
to start running from a statement in that procedure.

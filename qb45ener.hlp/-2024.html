<div class="page-title"> QuickBASIC Device Timeout</div>
<pre>While attempting to execute the File menu's Print command,
QuickBASIC tried repeatedly to send text to a printer
attached to the LPT1 port, without getting an acknowledging
signal back from the printer.
 
Make sure that there is a printer attached to LPT1.

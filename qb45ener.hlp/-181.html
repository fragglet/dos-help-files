<pre>This often occurs while you are debugging. While your
program is suspended (at a breakpoint, for example) you
made a change to the program that has implications
throughout the program, not just at the point where you
made the change. You may have redimensioned an array,
changed procedure arguments, or edited some other
declarative statement. Either
  ■ Choose &lt;OK&gt; to keep the change and restart the
    program. Or,
  ■ Choose &lt;Cancel&gt; to have QuickBASIC undo the change in
    your program text. You may do this if restarting the
    program interferes with your debugging strategy.

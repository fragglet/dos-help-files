    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<div class="page-title"> QuickBASIC Duplicate Definition</div>
<pre>You are attempting to create a new element in your program
and have given it a name that is already being used.
Examples of this are:
  ■ Giving a new procedure the name of an existing
    procedure.
  ■ Giving a new variable the name of an existing
    procedure.
  ■ Starting a variable name with the letters FN.
 
There can also be a conflict of file names. Attempting to
create a file using the name of a file that already exists
in the current directory will cause this error.
 
Either
  ■ Use a different name in the dialog box, or
  ■ Cancel the command and either change the name of the
    existing item that is causing the name conflict, or
    delete it.

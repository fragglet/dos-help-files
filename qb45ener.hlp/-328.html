The Calls menu shows the last eight procedure calls executed
prior to an untrapped error, a breakpoint or watchpoint, or
your pressing CTRL+BREAK.
 
The called procedures are arranged in the order of
execution, with the most recent on top. To view the program
text for any listed procedures, choose the procedure name
from the menu.
 
Tip: You can use the list of procedures in the Calls
     menu to control further program  execution, gradually
     "backing out" of the execution stack:
 
1. Choose a procedure name from Calls.
2. When the program text is displayed, the cursor will be on
   the line following the call that led to the point
   execution halted.
3. Press F7 to restart execution from that point to the
   cursor location.
4. Use the Watch window to look at variable values
   returned from procedures lower in the stack.

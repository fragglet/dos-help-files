<pre>This error can be caused by any of the following:
  ■  More than one DIM statement for the same static
     array.
  ■  A DIM statement after the initial use of an array.
  ■  An attempt to redimension a dynamic array with a
     DIM statement without using the ERASE statement to
     deallocate the array first.
  ■  An OPTION BASE statement that occurs after an
     array is dimensioned.

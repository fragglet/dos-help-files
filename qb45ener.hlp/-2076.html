<pre>QuickBASIC cannot find a path to the file name you
specified in the dialog box. QuickBASIC may have also
looked along these other paths, depending upon the file
name extension:
  ■ Paths specified by the Options menu's Set Paths command
  ■ Paths specified by DOS environmental variables
    PATH, INCLUDE, or LIB.
Note: If the file name is eight or less characters with
      no period, QuickBASIC assumes the extension .BAS.
      If the file name is between 9 and 11 characters,
      QuickBASIC puts a period after the eighth character.
First check to make sure you spelled the file name
correctly in the dialog box. If it is correct, you must
adjust the path specification in either the dialog box,
the Set Paths command, or the DOS environment variables.

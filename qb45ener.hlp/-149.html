    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>SUB...END SUB and FUNCTION...END FUNCTION statement blocks
are not permitted in include files.
 
Use the Merge command from the File menu to insert the
include file into the current module or load the include
file as a separate module.
 
If you load the include file as a separate module, some
restructuring may be necessary because shared variables
are shared only within the scope of the module.

The end of a SELECT CASE statement appears without a
beginning SELECT CASE.
 
The beginning of the SELECT CASE statement may be missing or
misspelled.
 
Also check other control structures within the
SELECT...END SELECT structure and verify that they are
correctly matched. For example, an IF block without a
matching ENDIF inside the SELECT...END SELECT structure
generates this error.

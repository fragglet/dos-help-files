<div class="page-title"> New SUB Command (Full Menus Only)</div>
<pre>Use New SUB to create a new SUB procedure as part of the
program or module in the View window.
 
A dialog box will prompt you for a procedure name.
QuickBASIC will then clear the View window and generate
the needed SUB and END SUB statements so you can start
entering text.
 
When you are through entering the new SUB, use the SUBs
command from the View menu (or press F2) to return to your
program. Your new SUB now appears in the SUBs command list.
 
 Tip: You can start a procedure editing screen without
      using a menu. Simply type the QuickBASIC keyword
      SUB followed by a procedure name.

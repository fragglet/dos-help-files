<pre>At compile time, this error occurs when include files are
nested more than five levels deep.
 
At run time, QuickBASIC limits the number of disk files
that can be open at any one time, and your program
has exceeded that limit. Either increase the FILES=
parameter in the CONFIG.SYS file, or simplify your
program.
 
DOS has a limit to the number of entries in a root
directory. If your program is opening and closing files
in a root directory, change your program so it uses a
subdirectory.
 
ERR code: 67

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<div class="page-title"> Illegal Function Call</div>
<pre>A parameter that is out of range has been passed to a
BASIC statement or function. For example, a screen row
number that is off the screen has been passed to the
LOCATE statement. Other examples of function call errors
are:
  ■ An unreasonably large subscript is used
  ■ A negative number is raised to a power that is not
    an integer
  ■ A negative record number is given GET or PUT file I/O
    statements
  ■ An I/O function or statement (LOC or LOF, for example)
    is performed on a device that does not support it.
  ■ Strings are concatenated to create a string greater
    than 32,767 characters in length (variable-length
    strings only)
  ■ A BLOAD or BSAVE operation is directed to a non-disk
    device
 
ERR code: 5

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<b>Explanation</b>
 
The directory cannot be removed for one of the following reasons:
 
1. It does not exist, or is misspelled.
 
2. It contains files or other subdirectories.
 
3. It is the current directory in this session or another session that is in
   process, or it is on a drive that is not current in any session.
 
4. It has the same name as an OS/2 reserved device name.
 
<b>Action</b>
 
Do one of the following, then retry the command:
 
1. Correct the directory name.
 
2. Remove all files and subdirectories from the directory.
 
3. Use the CHDIR command to change the current directory in all sessions
   that might be using it.
 
4. If the directory name is the same as an installed device, remove the
   device.

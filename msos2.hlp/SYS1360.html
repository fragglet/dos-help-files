<pre><b>SYS1360</b>
 
<b>Explanation</b>
 
<b>CHKDSK</b> was instructed to create files from the lost data blocks it has
found, but the root directory is full, and the lost chains could not be
recovered into files.
 
<b>Action</b>
 
Copy some of the recovered files to another disk for examination. Delete the
recovered files from the disk you are checking. Retry the CHKDSK command to
recover the remainder of the lost data.

The CHARMSG structure is used by the <a href='charmsg_dot_macro.html'>CHARMSG</a> macro to access key information
that is passed in the parameters of the WM_CHAR message. Unlike other MS
OS/2 structures, this structure is not defined as a type.
 
<b>Field     Description</b>
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
<b>chr</b>       Specifies the ASCII character.
 
<b>vkey</b>      Specifies the virtual key code.
 
<b>fs</b>        Specifies the keyboard control codes. This field can be one or
          more of the following values:
 
          Value           Meaning
          ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
          KC_CHAR         The usChr value is valid; otherwise, mp2 contains
                          zero.
 
          KC_SCANCODE     The uchScanCode value is valid; otherwise,
                          uchScanCode contains zero.
 
          KC_VIRTUALKEY   The usVKey value is valid; otherwise, usVKey
                          contains 0.
 
          KC_KEYUP        The event was a key-up transition; otherwise, it
                          was a key-down transition.
 
          KC_PREVDOWN     The key was previously down; otherwise, it was
                          previously up.
 
          KC_DEADKEY      The character code is a dead key. The application
                          must display the glyph for the dead key without
                          advancing the cursor.
 
          KC_COMPOSITE    The character code is formed by combining the
                          current key with the previous dead key.
 
          KC_INVALIDCOMP  The character code is not a valid combination with
                          the preceding dead key. The application must
                          advance the cursor past the dead-key glyph and
                          then, if the current character is not a space, the
                          application beeps the speaker and displays the new
                          character code.
 
          KC_LONEKEY      This bit is set if the key was pressed and
                          released with no other keys being pressed or
                          released between the time the key was pressed and
                          the time it was released.
 
          KC_SHIFT        The shift state was active when the key was
                          pressed or released.
 
          KC_ALT          The ALT state was active when the key was pressed
                          or released.
 
          KC_CTRL         The CONTROL state was active when the key was
                          pressed or released.
 
<b>cRepeat</b>   Specifies the key repeat count.
 
<b>scancode</b>  Specifies the character scan code.

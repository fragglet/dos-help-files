    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<b>Style            Description</b>
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
<i>CS_CLIPCHILDREN</i>  Prevents a window from painting over its child window. This
                 style protects child windows but increases the time
                 necessary to calculate the visible region. This style is
                 normally not necessary, since if the parent and child
                 windows overlap and are both invalidated, the parent window
                 is drawn before the child window. If the child window is
                 invalidated independently from the parent window, only the
                 child window is redrawn. If the update region of the parent
                 window does not intersect the child window, drawing the
                 parent window should not disturb the child window.
 
<i>CS_CLIPSIBLINGS</i>  Prevents a window from painting over its sibling windows.
                 This style protects windows with the same parent window
                 from being drawn accidentally but increases the time
                 necessary to calculate the visible region. This style is
                 appropriate for windows that overlap and that have the same
                 parent window.
 
<i>CS_PARENTCLIP</i>    Prevents a window from painting over its parent windows.
                 This style simplifies the calculation of the visible region
                 but is potentially hazardous, because the parent window's
                 visible region is usually larger than the child window.
                 Windows with this style should not draw outside their
                 boundaries.
 
<i>CS_SAVEBITS</i>      Saves the image underneath the window as a bitmap. When the
                 user moves or hides the window, the system restores the
                 image by copying the bits; there is no need to add the area
                 to the uncovered window's update region. Because this
                 operation can consume a great deal of memory, it is
                 recommended only for transient windows such as menus and
                 dialog boxes, not for main application windows.
 
<i>CS_SYNCPAINT     Causes the window t</i>o receive WM_PAINT messages immediately
                 after a part of the window becomes invalid. Without this
                 style, the window receives WM_PAINT messages only if no
                 other message is waiting to be processed.
 
<i>CS_SIZEREDRAW    Causes the window to r</i>eceive a WM_PAINT message and be
                 completely invalidated whenever the user resizes the
                 window, even if it is made smaller. (Typically, only the
                 uncovered area of a window is invalidated when the user
                 resizes a window.) The system positions the resized window
                 relative to the lower-left corner of its parent window.
                 Without this style, the system positions the window
                 relative to the upper-left corner of its parent window.
                 This class style is useful when an application scales
                 graphics to fill the current window.
 
<i>CS_FRAME</i>         Identifies windows created with this class as frame
                 windows.
 
<i>CS_PUBLIC</i>        Creates a public window class.
 
<i>CS_HITTEST       Directs the s</i>ystem to send WM_HITTEST messages to windows
                 of this class whenever the mouse pointer moves in the
                 window.
 
<i>CS_MOVENOTIFY    Directs the system to </i>send WM_MOVE messages to the window
                 whenever the user moves the window.

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<b>Style               Description</b>
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
<i>BS_3STATE</i>           Same as an auto-check box, except that the state of the
                    box alternates between selected, unselected, and
                    halftone. The owner window receives a WM_CONTROL message
                    and changes the state of the three-state check box when
                    the user selects the box.
 
<i>BS_AUTO3STATE</i>       Same as a three-state check box, except that the box
                    changes its state when the user selects it.
 
<i>BS_AUTOCHECKBOX</i>     Same as a check box, except that an X appears in the
                    check box when the user selects the box; the X
                    disappears the next time the user selects the box. An
                    auto-check box sends a WM_CONTROL message to its owner
                    window.
 
<i>BS_AUTORADIOBUTTON</i>  Same as a radio button, except that when the user
                    selects it, the button automatically highlights itself
                    and removes the selection from any other auto-radio
                    buttons in the same group.
 
<i>BS_CHECKBOX</i>         Creates a small square that has text displayed to its
                    right. When the user selects the box, the check box
                    posts a WM_CONTROL message to its owner window, which
                    changes the check-box state.
 
<i>BS_DEFAULT</i>          Creates a button that has a heavy black border. The user
                    can select this button by pressing the ENTER key. This
                    style is useful for enabling the user to quickly select
                    the most likely option (the default option).
 
<i>BS_HELP             C</i>reates a button that posts a WM_HELP message to its
                    owner window when the user selects the button.
 
<i>BS_NOBORDER</i>         Creates a button that has no border.
 
<i>BS_NOCURSORSELECT</i>   When used with the BS_AUTORADIOBUTTON style, prevents
                    the button from being selected automatically when the
                    user moves the cursor to the button by pressing the
                    cursor-movement keys.
 
<i>BS_NOPOINTERFOCUS</i>   Creates a button that does not receive the focus when
                    the user selects the button.
 
<i>BS_PUSHBUTTON       Creates a push butt</i>on that posts a WM_COMMAND message to
                    the owner window when the user selects the button.
 
<i>BS_RADIOBUTTON</i>      Creates a small circle that has text displayed to its
                    right. Radio buttons are usually used in groups of
                    related but mutually exclusive choices. When selected,
                    the button posts a WM_CONTROL message to its owner
                    window and changes the state of the selected radio
                    button and the other buttons in the group.
 
<i>BS_SYSCOMMAND       Creates a button th</i>at posts a WM_SYSCOMMAND message to
                    its owner window when the user selects the button.
 
<i>BS_USERBUTTON</i>       Creates a user-defined button that notifies the parent
                    window when the user selects the button. Notification
                    may include a request to paint, invert, or disable the
                    button. The owner window receives a WM_PAINT message
                    when the button must be drawn.

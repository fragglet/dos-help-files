    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<b>Use of the Navigation Buttons</b>
 
    At the top of each topic is a row of navigation buttons. The Up, Next,
    and Previous buttons appear on the upper right of all topics except MS
    OS/2.
 
    The Up button moves you up a level, to the topics list that includes the
    topic from which you clicked the Up button. Wherever you start from, if
    you click the Up button repeatedly, you will eventually get to the topic
    MS OS/2.
 
    The action of the Next button depends on the level of the topic you are
    looking at. From descriptions of functions, messages, etc., the Next
    button takes you to the description that is next alphabetically. From a
    list, the Next button takes you to th e next related list. For example,
    if you are looking at the alphabetic list of Dos functions, the Next
    button takes you to the alphabetic list of Gpi functions.
 
    The Previous button takes you to the historically previous topic.
    QuickHelp maintains a history of the last 23 topics you have viewed.
    Click the Previous button repeatedly to step backwards through these 23
    topics.
 
<b>Searching for Functions</b>
 
    You can search for a function or message by using the S key (Search),
    even if you don't remember the exact spelling of the target topic. If
    QuickHelp cannot find the topic you asked it to search for, and the
    beginning of the search string matches one of the MS OS/2 functions or
    messages, QuickHelp displays an alphabetic list of functions or
    messages, with the closest match highlighted. For example, if you search
    for the string "DosExecProgram", QuickHelp displays the alphabetic list
    of Dos functions, with the "DosExecPgm" topic highlighted.
 
    It is not necessary to type the entire name of a function (or any other
    topic). You can type as much of the name as is needed for a a unique
    search pattern, then end the string with an asterisk (*). QuickHelp
    displays the first topic that matches all the characters up to the
    asterisk character. If the topic displayed is not the one you want,
    press the E key, and QuickHelp will display the next match (if any).
 
    You can get an alphabetic list of MS OS/2 functions by searching for the
    three-letter prefix. For example, to get a list of Gpi functions, search
    for the string "GPI".
 
<b>Searching for Constants</b>
 
    If you know the prefix of a constant, you can find the list──if one
    exists──of all constants matching that prefix; to search for such a
    list, use the prefix followed by an underscore as your search string.
    For example, if you want to find the list of resource types, search for
    "RT_".
 
    To find the spelling of a specific constant, type as much of the string
    as you are certain of, then end the string with the asterisk (*)
    character. QuickHelp displays the first topic that matches all the
    characters up to the asterisk character. If the top ic displayed is not
    the one you want, press the E key to continue the search until you get
    the desired constant. For example, if you want to set the system
    double-click rate, but you don't remember the full name of the constant,
    search for "SV_D*". QuickHelp displays the first topic starting with
    "SV_D", and you can use the E key to step through all topics with that
    prefix.
 
    Alternatively, you can search by using the D key (Duplicate Search)
    instead of the S key. In this case, QuickHelp displays a list of all
    topics that match the string, along with the title of the database in
    which each topic appears.

<b>Class          Description</b>
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
<i>WC_BUTTON</i>      Creates a button (a small child window representing a
               button), which the user can turn on or off by selecting. You
               can use buttons singly or in groups; they can appear with or
               without text. The appearance of a button typically changes
               when the user selects it. See also, <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='BS_.html'>Button styles</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
<i>WC_COMBOBOX</i>    Creates a combination box. A combination box combines a list
               box and an entry field, enabling the user to enter data
               either by typing in the entry field or by choosing from a
               list in the list box. See also, <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='CBS_.html'>Combination-box styles</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
<i>WC_ENTRYFIELD</i>  Creates an entry field. An entry field is a rectangular child
               window in which the user can enter text from the keyboard.
               The user selects the entry field and gives it the input focus
               by using the mouse or the TAB key. The user can enter text
               when the control displays an insertion point. By using the
               mouse or the ARROW keys, the user can either select the
               character or characters to delete or select the place at
               which to insert new characters. The user can also press the
               BKSP key to delete characters. See also,

<i>WC_FRAME</i>       Creates a frame window. A frame window provides the base for
               creating composite windows, such as as dialog boxes and the
               application's main window. A frame window coordinates the
               activities of one or more child and/or owned windows,
               permitting the composite to function as a single window.
               Menus, title bars, sizing borders, standard scroll bars, and
               client windows all can be child and/or owned windows of the
               frame window. See also, <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='FS_.html'>Frame-window styles</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
<i>WC_LISTBOX</i>     Creates a list box. A list box consists of a list of
               character strings. You can use a list box to present a list
               of names, such as filenames, that the user can view and
               select. The user can select a string by using the mouse or by
               using the ARROW keys. Selecting a string highlights it and
               passes a notification message to the parent window. You can
               include a scroll bar with a list box enabling the user to
               scroll lists that are too long or too wide for the control
               window. See also, <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='LS_.html'>List-box styles</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
<i>WC_MENU</i>        Creates a menu. A menu is a window that contains a list of
               items. These items can be text strings, bitmaps, or images
               drawn by the application. Menus enable the user to select
               from a predetermined list of choices, by using the mouse or
               keyboard. When the user makes a selection from a menu, the
               menu posts a message, containing a unique menu-item
               identifier, to the owner window of the menu. See also,
               <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='MIS_.html'>Menu styles</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
<i>WC_MLE</i>         Creates a multiple-line entry field (MLE). An MLE is a
               rectangular child window in which the user can enter multiple
               lines of text from the keyboard. The user selects the MLE and
               gives it the input focus either by using the mouse or the TAB
               key. The user can enter text when the MLE displays an
               insertion point. By using the mouse or the ARROW keys, the
               user can select the character or characters to delete, or
               select the place at which to insert new characters. The user
               can also press the BKSP key to delete characters. See also,
               <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='MLS_.html'>Multiple-line entry-field styles</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
<i>WC_SCROLLBAR</i>   Creates a scroll bar. A scroll bar is a rectangular window
               containing a slider and direction arrows at both ends. The
               scroll bar sends a notification message to its parent window
               whenever the user clicks the mouse in it or uses the ARROW
               keys to scroll the contents of the window. The parent updates
               the position of the slider, if necessary. You can position
               scroll bars anywhere in a window and use them whenever you
               need to provide scrolling input for a window.

<i>WC_STATIC</i>      Creates a static control. Static controls are simple text
               fields, boxes, and rectangles that you can use to label, box,
               or separate other controls. Static controls take no input and
               provide no output. See also, <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='SS_.html'>Static styles</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
<i>WC_TITLEBAR</i>    Creates a title bar. A title bar, part of a standard frame
               window, performs four functions. It displays the title of the
               window across the top of the frame window. It changes its
               highlight appearance to show whether the frame window is
               active. It responds to the user──for example, when the user
               drags the frame window to a new location on the display. And
               it flashes, notifying the user of an event. A title bar sends
               messages to its owner window when the title bar receives user
               input.

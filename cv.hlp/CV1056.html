<pre>     Cannot understand entry in TOOLS.INI or CURRENT.STS (CV1056)
 
     At least one line in the given file (either the state file or the
     TOOLS.INI file) could not be interpreted.
 
     On start-up, CodeView reads the state file (CURRENT.STS) and the
     TOOLS.INI file (if the latter is available).
 
     Examine the given file to find the problem.

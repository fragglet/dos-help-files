     No free EMM memory handles (CV3005)
 
     No expanded memory handle is available for the symbolic
     information.
 
     One of the following may be a solution:
 
        ■ If multiple applications are running, remove one or more of
          the applications that use expanded memory. This should free
          enough handles to permit CodeView to run properly.
 
        ■ Reconfigure the EMM driver to allow more handles.

     Cannot read file (CV5004)
 
     A file was selected from a dialog box, and CodeView then opened
     the file. The read process failed while the file was being read.
 
     Read the file again. If the second read fails, exit and restart
     CodeView. If the read process still fails, the file may be
     corrupt.

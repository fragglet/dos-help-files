<pre>     Too many watch objects (CV1036)
 
     More watch objects were specified than CodeView can handle.
 
     The number of watch expressions that can be specified varies with
     the demands made upon CodeView's internal memory resources.
 
     Remove one or more of the watch expressions, or remove some
     breakpoints.

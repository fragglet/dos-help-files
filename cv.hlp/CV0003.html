     The program has terminated, restart to continue. (CV0003)
 
     CodeView has detected a termination request by the program being
     debugged.
 
     The program cannot be executed because it has terminated and has
     not been restarted. Program memory remains allocated and may still
     be examined at this point.
 
     To run the program again, reload it using the Restart command.

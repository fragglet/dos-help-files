    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>     The program has terminated, restart to continue. (CV0003)
 
     CodeView has detected a termination request by the program being
     debugged.
 
     The program cannot be executed because it has terminated and has
     not been restarted. Program memory remains allocated and may still
     be examined at this point.
 
     To run the program again, reload it using the Restart command.
                                    -♦-

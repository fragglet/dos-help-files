     Insufficient EMM memory (CV3007)
 
     CodeView tried to allocate expanded memory, but there was not
     enough space.
 
     Possible solutions include the following:
 
        ■ Run CVPACK on the executable file to reduce the demand on
          memory for symbolic information.
 
        ■ Recompile without symbolic information in some of the
          modules. CodeView requires memory to hold information about
          the program being debugged. Compile some modules with the /Zd
          option instead of /Zi, or don't use either option.
 
        ■ If multiple applications are running, remove one or more of
          the applications that use expanded memory. This may free
          enough memory to permit CodeView to run properly.
 
        ■ Allocate more expanded memory in the system configuration.

<pre>     Cannot use struct or union as scalar (CV1025)
 
     A structure or union was used in an expression, but no element was
     specified.
 
     When requesting display of a structure or union variable, the name
     of the variable may appear by itself, without a field qualifier.
     If a structure or union is used in an expression, it must be
     qualified with the specific element desired.
 
     Specify the element whose value is to be used in the expression.

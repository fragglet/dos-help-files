────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
     The Calls menu changes its contents and size depending on the
     status of your program.
 
     When you choose a function from the Calls menu, CodeView displays
     that function. The cursor moves to the "returned" instruction for
     the function you choose. Usually, this corresponds to the source
     line immediately following the function call.
 
     The Local window is updated to show the local variables for that
     call. On recursive calls, the Local window is updated to reflect
     only the first call.
 
     Choosing a routine from the Calls menu does not affect program
     execution; instead, it provides you with a convenient way to view
     routines and local variables on the call stack.
 
     The Calls menu shows the current routine and the trail of routines
     from which it was called. The current routine is always at the
     top of the menu; the routine from which the current routine was
     called is directly below. Other active routines are shown in the
     reverse order in which they were called.
 
     With C programs, the bottom routine should always be the routine
     main.
 
     EXCEPTIONS:
 
        ■ The start-up or termination routines are traced from the run-
          time library.
 
        ■ Function calls are nested so deeply that the routine main
          does not appear on the menu.
 
        ■ The stack has been corrupted.
 
        ■ The stack frame is not present because a function overwrote
          the contents of the BP register.
 
     The current value of each argument, if any, is shown in
     parentheses following the routine. The menu expands to accommodate
     the arguments of the widest routine. Arguments are shown in the
     current radix; the default is decimal.

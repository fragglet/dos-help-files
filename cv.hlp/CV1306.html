<pre>     /E: no EMM handle available (CV1306)
 
     No handle is available for the CodeView overlay code.
 
     One of the following may be a solution:
 
        ■ If possible, increase the number of EMM handles that are
          allocated when the EMM driver is loaded.
 
        ■ If multiple applications are running, remove one or more of
          the applications that use expanded memory. This should free
          enough handles to permit CodeView to run properly.
 
        ■ Some memory may have become inaccessible due to program
          error. Reboot in order to free the memory.

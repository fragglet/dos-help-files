<pre>     Cannot open \SHAREMEM\CVP (CV3606)
 
     The required shared memory could not be opened.
 
     When debugging multiprocess programs, CodeView tries to access
     areas of shared memory for interprocess communication.
 
     The failure to open shared memory may be due to lack of memory or
     to having too many OS/2 processes running at one time.

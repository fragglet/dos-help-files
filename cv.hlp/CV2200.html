     CodeView could not open a disk file (tape) to record commands and
     data for later replay.
 
     Choosing the History On option from the Run menu causes CodeView
     to open disk files &lt;program&gt; .CVH and &lt;program&gt; .CVI to record all
     commands and data for a debugging session.
 
     One of the following situations may have caused the error:
 
        ■ There was not enough space on the disk containing the program
          to be debugged.
 
        ■ There were not enough free file handles. In DOS, increase the
          number of file handles by changing the FILES setting in
          CONFIG.SYS to allow a larger number of open files. FILES=20
          is the recommended setting. In OS/2, if multiple processes
          are running, removing one or more of them may release enough
          file handles to permit creating the tape.

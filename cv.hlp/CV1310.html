<pre>     Cannot open CV.EXE (CV1310)
 
     An error occurred while CV.EXE was being opened.
 
     One of the following may have occurred:
 
        ■ The file could be corrupt. Copy CV.EXE from the original
          disks and retry.
 
        ■ The operating system could not find CV.EXE due to a disk error.
 
        ■ There were not enough free file handles. In DOS, increase the
          number of file handles by changing the FILES setting in
          CONFIG.SYS to allow a larger number of open files. FILES=20
          is the recommended setting. In OS/2, if multiple processes
          are running, removing one or more of them may release enough
          file handles.
 
     If the error recurs, note the circumstances of the error and
     notify Microsoft Corporation by following the instructions in the
     Microsoft Product Assistance Request form at the back of one of
     your manuals.

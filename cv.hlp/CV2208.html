<pre>     User Tape Disabled (CV2208)
 
     The current CodeView session was invoked with the /K option to
     disable the keyboard. CodeView issues this warning as a reminder
     that the recording ability is limited when /K is used. You can
     record CodeView commands made during a debugging session, but not
     user keystrokes.

     Opening a shell requires a significant amount of free memory,
     since the following are resident in memory:
 
        ■ CodeView
 
        ■ The symbol table
 
        ■ The system's command processor
 
        ■ The program being debugged
 
     If your machine does not have enough memory, an error message
     appears. Even if you have enough memory to start a new shell, you
     may not have enough memory left to execute large programs from the
     shell.
 
     In order for you to use the Shell Escape commands, the executable
     file being debugged must release unneeded memory. Programs created
     with Microsoft compilers release memory during start-up.
 
     Side effects of commands executed while in a shell may not be seen
     when you return to CodeView, such as a changed directory.

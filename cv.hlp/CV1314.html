     Not enough memory to load CV.EXE (CV1314)
 
     There was not enough conventional memory to load CodeView.
 
     Possible solutions include the following:
 
        ■ Free memory by removing terminate-and-stay-resident software.
 
        ■ Reduce the settings in CONFIG.SYS for FILES, BUFFERS, and
          LASTDRIVE.

<pre>     Unable to open tape (CV2201)
 
     CodeView could not open the history file (tape) for replay.
 
     Choosing the History On option from the Run menu causes CodeView
     to open disk files .CVH and .CVI to record all commands and data
     for a debugging session.
 
     There probably were not enough free file handles. In DOS, increase
     the number of file handles by changing the FILES setting in
     CONFIG.SYS to allow a larger number of open files. FILES=20 is the
     recommended setting. In OS/2, if multiple processes are running,
     removing one or more of them may release enough file handles to
     permit opening the tape.

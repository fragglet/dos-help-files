     Video mode changed without /S option (CV1040)
 
     The program being debugged changed screen modes, and CodeView was
     not set for swapping. The program output is now damaged or
     unrecoverable.
 
     To be able to view program output, exit CodeView and restart it
     with the Swap (/S) option.

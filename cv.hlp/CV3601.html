     Cannot create \QUEUES\CVP (CV3601)
 
     One or more of the required queues could not be created.
 
     When debugging multiprocess programs, CodeView creates multiple
     copies of itself that intercommunicate through queues.
 
     The failure to create queues may be due to lack of memory, or to
     having too many OS/2 processes running at one time.

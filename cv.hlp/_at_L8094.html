     The Move Memory (M) command copies all the values in one block of
     memory directly to another block of memory of the same size. All
     data in the source block is guaranteed to be copied completely
     over to the destination block, even if the two blocks overlap.
     However, if they do overlap, some of the original data in the
     memory range is altered.
 
     When the source is at a higher address than the destination, the
     Move Memory command copies data starting at the source block's
     lowest address. When the source is at a lower address, the Move
     Memory command copies data beginning at the source block's highest
     address. This mechanism helps to prevent loss of data after the
     move.
 
     Use the Move Memory command to program in Assembly mode, or to
     transfer large amounts of data in other programs. For example, use
     this command to copy all the values in one array to the elements
     of another.

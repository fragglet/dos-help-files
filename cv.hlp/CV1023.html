<pre>     No code at this line number (CV1023)
 
     An attempt was made to set a breakpoint at a line that does not
     correspond to machine code. Such a line could be a blank line, a
     comment line, a line with program declarations, or a line moved or
     removed by compiler optimization.
 
     To set a breakpoint at a line deleted by the optimizer, recompile
     the program with the /Od option to turn optimization off.
 
     Note that in a multiline statement the code is associated only
     with one line of the statement.

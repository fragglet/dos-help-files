     Cannot create \SHAREMEM\CVP (CV3604)
 
     The required shared memory could not be assigned.
 
     When debugging multiprocess programs, CodeView allocates areas of
     shared memory for interprocess communication.
 
     The failure to assign shared memory may be due to lack of memory,
     or to having too many OS/2 processes running at one time.

     Use the DOS Shell command or OS/2 Shell command to leave CodeView
     temporarily. In the new shell, you can use operating-system
     commands for such tasks as deleting, copying, and renaming files.
 
     To create the new shell and then return to CodeView:
 
       1. Choose the Shell command from the File menu.
 
       2. Perform any tasks.
 
          EXCEPTIONS:
 
             ■ Don't start terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs,
               such as MSHERC.COM.
 
             ■ Don't delete files you worked on during this session or
               any files used by CodeView.
 
       3. Type "Exit" at the operating-system prompt to return to
          CodeView.
 
     The Shell command saves the current processes in memory and then
     executes a second copy of COMMAND.COM or CMD.EXE, as specified by
     the COMSPEC environment variable. If you don't have enough memory,
     an error message appears. Even if you have enough memory for the
     command processor, you may not have enough left to execute large
     programs from the shell.

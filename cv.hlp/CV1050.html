<pre>     Expression not a memory address (CV1050)
 
     The expression entered does not evaluate to an address. An address
     must be a numeric value.
 
     An lvalue (so called because it appears on the left side of an
     assignment statement) is an expression that refers to a memory
     location.
 
     For example, buffer[count] is a valid lvalue because it points to
     a specific memory location. The logical comparison zed != 0 is not
     a valid lvalue because it evaluates to TRUE or FALSE, not a memory
     address.

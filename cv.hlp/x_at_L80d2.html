          004&gt;~
 
     The example above displays the status of all threads, including
     their corresponding numbers.
 
          004&gt;~2
 
     The example above displays the status of thread 2.
 
          004&gt;~5S
 
     The example above selects thread 5 as the current thread. Since
     the current thread is 4 (a fact apparent from the CodeView
     prompt), the current thread is changing. Therefore, you can expect
     all registers and code displayed to change.
 
          005&gt;~3BP .64
 
     The example above sets a breakpoint at source line 64, an action
     that stops program execution only when thread 3 executes to this
     line.
 
          005&gt;~1F
 
     The example above freezes thread 1.
 
          005&gt;~*U
 
     The example above unfreezes all threads; any threads that were
     frozen before will now be free to execute whenever the Go
     command is given. If no threads are frozen, this command has no
     effect.
 
          005&gt;~2E
 
     The example above selects thread 2 as the current thread, then
     proceeds to execute thread 2 in slow motion.
 
          002&gt;~3S
          003&gt;~.F
          003&gt;~#S
          002&gt;
 
     The example above selects thread 3 as the current thread, freezes
     the current thread (thread 3), and switches back to thread 2.
     After switching to thread 3, no code was executed; therefore, the
     debugger considers the # symbol to refer to thread 2, the last
     thread executed.

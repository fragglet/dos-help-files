<pre>     Expression too complex (CV1019)
 
     The expression entered was too complex for the amount of storage
     space available to the expression evaluator.
 
     Overflow usually occurs because of too many pending calculations.
     Rearrange the expression so that each component of the expression
     can be evaluated immediately, rather than having to wait for other
     parts of the expression to be calculated.
                                    -â™¦-

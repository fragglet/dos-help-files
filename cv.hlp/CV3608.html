<pre>     Out of memory (CV3608)
 
     CodeView needed additional conventional memory, but insufficient
     memory was available.
 
     Possible solutions include the following:
 
        ■ Run CVPACK on the executable file to reduce the demand on
          memory for symbolic information.
 
        ■ Recompile without symbolic information in some of the
          modules. CodeView requires memory to hold information about
          the program being debugged. Compile some modules with the /Zd
          option instead of /Zi, or don't use either option.
 
        ■ Remove other programs or drivers running in the system that
          could be consuming significant amounts of memory.
 
        ■ Free some memory by removing terminate-and-stay-resident
          software.
 
        ■ Remove unneeded watches or breakpoints.
 
        ■ Compile some modules with optimizations enabled to reduce the
          demand on memory made by the program being debugged.

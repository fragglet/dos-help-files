     The Thread (~) command specifies the thread or threads to which
     CodeView commands apply. You can specify all threads or just a
     particular thread. If you do not specify a thread, any commands
     you give apply to all threads.
 
     The Thread command also determines which activity the debugger
     carries out with the specified thread. For example, you can
     execute the thread, freeze its execution, or select it as the
     current thread.
 
     If you give the Thread command without any other CodeView
     commands, the debugger displays the status of the specified
     thread. If you omit both command and specifier, the debugger
     displays the status of all threads.
 
     The status display for threads consists of the two fields
 
          thread-id thread-state
 
     in which &lt;thread-id&gt; is an integer and &lt;thread-state&gt; has the
     value "runnable" or "frozen." All threads not frozen by CodeView
     are displayed as runnable; this includes threads that may be
     blocked for reasons that have nothing to do with the debugger,
     such as a critical section.

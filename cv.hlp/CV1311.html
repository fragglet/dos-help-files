     Cannot read CV.EXE (CV1311)
 
     An error occurred while CV.EXE was being read. Possibly the
     operating system could not find CV.EXE due to a disk error.
 
     If the error recurs, note the circumstances of the error and
     notify Microsoft Corporation by following the instructions in the
     Microsoft Product Assistance Request form at the back of one of
     your manuals.

<pre>     Cannot open \SEM\CVP (CV3607)
 
     The required semaphore could not be opened.
 
     When debugging multiprocess programs, CodeView tries to access
     areas of shared memory for interprocess communication.
 
     The failure to open a semaphore may be due to lack of memory or
     to having too many OS/2 processes running at one time.

     CVP.EXE, the protected-mode version of CodeView, has the following
     restrictions:
 
        ■ If you want to switch between the CodeView screen and the
          output screen of the program you are debugging, you must
          use CodeView's F4 key or <a href='x_at_L804b.html'>Screen Exchange (\)</a>
          command. You cannot use the OS/2 Task Manager.
          See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='x_at_L804b.html'>Screen Exchange (\) Command-Window Command</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
        ■ You cannot debug asynchronously. That is, you cannot execute
          the program you are debugging in one screen group and perform
          other CodeView operations in a second screen group.
 
        ■ To debug a bound program in OS/2 running in the DOS session,
          you must link the program with the OS2.LIB library.
 
        ■ To terminate the program you are debugging, you must type
          CTRL+BREAK or ALT+SYSREQ. CTRL+C does not stop the program.
 
          NOTE: CTRL+C may be used to pass a "break" signal to a
                handler in the program.
 
        ■ Breakpoints in parts of the program that handle messages are
          likely to cause deadlock conditions.
 
        ■ In a multithread program, a thread may not stop at a
          breakpoint if all threads are in a critical section of
          Presentation Manager code.

<pre>     EMM software error (CV3000)
 
     An error has occurred in the EMM driver.
 
     Exit CodeView and reboot the computer. If the problem recurs,
     replace the EMM driver file with a fresh copy from the EMM
     driver's distribution disk. If this does not correct the problem,
     the expanded memory board may need service.

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>     Too many open files (CV0024)
 
     CodeView could not open a file it needed because no more file
     handles are available.
 
     In DOS, increase the number of file handles by changing the FILES
     setting in CONFIG.SYS to allow a larger number of open files.
     FILES=20 is the recommended setting. In OS/2, if multiple
     processes are running, removing one or more of them may release
     enough file handles.
 
     The program being debugged may have so many files open that all
     available handles are exhausted. Check that the program has not
     left files open unnecessarily. The first four handles are reserved
     by the operating system.
                                    -â™¦-

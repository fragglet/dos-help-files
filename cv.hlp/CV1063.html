<pre>     Cannot create CURRENT.STS (CV1063)
 
     CodeView could not find an existing state file (CURRENT.STS), and
     it tried to create one but failed.
 
     One of the following may have occurred:
 
        ■ There was not enough space either on the disk containing the
          program to be debugged or on the disk pointed to by the INIT
          environment variable.
 
        ■ There were not enough free file handles. In DOS, increase the
          number of file handles by changing the FILES setting in
          CONFIG.SYS to allow a larger number of open files. FILES=20
          is the recommended setting. In OS/2, if multiple processes
          are running, removing one or more of them may release enough
          file handles.
 
        ■ The environment variable INIT pointed to a directory that
          does not exist. If the variable points to more than one
          directory, the first directory listed does not exist.

<pre>     Out of memory (CV0012)
 
     CodeView was unable to allocate or reallocate the memory that it
     required because not enough memory was available.
 
     Possible solutions include the following:
 
        ■ Run CVPACK on the executable file to reduce the demand on
          memory for symbolic information.
 
        ■ Recompile without symbolic information in some of the
          modules. CodeView requires memory to hold information about
          the program being debugged. Compile some modules with the /Zd
          option instead of /Zi, or don't use either option.
 
        ■ Remove other programs or drivers running in the system that
          could be consuming significant amounts of memory.
 
        ■ Decrease the settings in CONFIG.SYS for FILES and BUFFERS.

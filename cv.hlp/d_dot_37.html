     This dialog box appears when you are about to overwrite part of
     the existing debug history file. This can happen in two cases:
 
        ■ During the replay of the debug history, the Undo command was
          used to go back one step, or the Browse command was used to
          go back multiple steps.
 
        ■ The entire previous debug history was replayed.
 
     Then a Go, Trace, Step (or other operation that would normally be
     part of debug history) was requested.
 
     At this point, you have two options. The Overwrite History option
     will erase any previously recorded debug history from your current
     location onward.
 
     The Turn History Off option will preserve previously recorded
     information, but will not record any history for the currently
     requested operation.

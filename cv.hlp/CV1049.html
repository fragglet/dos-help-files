    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>     Address of register variable cannot be watched (CV1049)
 
     An attempt was made to evaluate the address of a register
     variable. A register variable can be watched but not the address
     of a register variable.
 
     One of the following occurred:
 
        ■ The variable was declared as a register variable. Recompile
          the program with the register declaration removed.
 
        ■ The optimizer converted an ordinary variable into a register
          variable to speed up execution. Recompile the program using
          the /Od option to turn optimization off.
 
        ■ The function was defined with _fastcall, causing parameters
          to be passed in registers. Remove the _fastcall designation
          and recompile.

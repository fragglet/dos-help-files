<pre>     Address of register variable cannot be watched (CV1049)
 
     An attempt was made to evaluate the address of a register
     variable. A register variable can be watched but not the address
     of a register variable.
 
     One of the following occurred:
 
        ■ The variable was declared as a register variable. Recompile
          the program with the register declaration removed.
 
        ■ The optimizer converted an ordinary variable into a register
          variable to speed up execution. Recompile the program using
          the /Od option to turn optimization off.
 
        ■ The function was defined with _fastcall, causing parameters
          to be passed in registers. Remove the _fastcall designation
          and recompile.

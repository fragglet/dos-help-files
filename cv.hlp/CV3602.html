     Cannot open \QUEUES\CVP (CV3602)
 
     One or more of the required queues could not be opened.
 
     When debugging multiprocess programs, CodeView creates multiple
     copies of itself that intercommunicate through queues.
 
     The failure to open queues may be due to lack of memory or to
     having too many OS/2 processes running at one time.

     LIM 4.0 subfunction not supported (CV3014)
 
     CodeView required a subfunction that is not supported in the EMM
     driver present on the system.
 
     Either of the following must be done:
 
        ■ Run CodeView without using expanded memory.
 
        ■ Obtain an EMM driver that fully supports LIM EMS version 4.0
          or later.
                                    -♦-

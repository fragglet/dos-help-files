     One of the CodeView processes sent a command or data to another
     CodeView process that the latter process did not recognize. This
     is not a fatal error.
 
     If this is a recurring error, please note the circumstances of the
     error and notify Microsoft Corporation by following the
     instructions in the Microsoft Product Assistance Request form at
     the back of one of your manuals.

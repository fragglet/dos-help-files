     Function call before stack frame initialization (CV1026)
 
     A function call cannot be executed until after the BP (stack
     frame) register has been initialized.
 
     Run the program to a statement that follows initialization of the
     BP register. This is usually set up as the first statement in the
     first function of the program.

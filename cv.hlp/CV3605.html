     Cannot create \SEM\CVP (CV3605)
 
     The required semaphore could not be assigned.
 
     When debugging multiprocess programs, CodeView allocates areas of
     shared memory for interprocess communication.
 
     The failure to assign a semaphore may be due to lack of memory or
     to having too many OS/2 processes running at one time.

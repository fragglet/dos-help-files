    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<b>MCI_PLAY</b>
 
        This MCI command message signals the device to begin
        transmitting output data. Support of this message by a device is
        optional. The parameters and flags for this message vary
        according to the selected device.
 
<u>Parameters</u>
        DWORD dwFlags
            The following flags apply to all devices supporting
            MCI_PLAY:
 
            MCI_NOTIFY
                Specifies that MCI should post the MM_MCINOTIFY message
                when this command completes. The window to receive this
                message is specified in the <a href='MCI_PLAY_PARMS.html'>dwCallback</a> field of the data
                structure identified by lpPlay.
 
            MCI_WAIT
                Specifies that the play operation should finish before
                MCI returns control to the application.
 
            MCI_FROM
                Specifies that a starting position is included in the
                <a href='MCI_PLAY_PARMS.html'>dwFrom</a> field of the data structure identified by lpPlay.
                The units assigned to the position values is specified
                with the MCI_SET_TIME_FORMAT flag of the MCI_SET
                command. If MCI_FROM is not specified, the starting
                position defaults to the current location.
 
            MCI_TO
                Specifies that an ending position is included in the
                <a href='MCI_PLAY_PARMS.html'>dwTo</a> field of the data structure identified by lpPlay.
                The units assigned to the position values is specified
                with the MCI_SET_TIME_FORMAT flag of the MCI_SET
                command. If MCI_TO is not specified, the end position
                defaults to the end of the media.
 
        LPMCI_PLAY_PARMS lpPlay
            Specifies a far pointer to an MCI_PLAY_PARMS data structure.
            (Devices with extended command sets might replace this data
            structure with a device-specific data structure.)
 
        Animation Extensions
 
        DWORD dwFlags
            The following additional flags apply to animation devices:
 
            MCI_ANIM_PLAY_FAST

            MCI_ANIM_PLAY_SLOW
                Specifies to play slowly.
 
            MCI_ANIM_PLAY_SPEED
                Specifies that the play speed is included in the
                <a href='MCI_ANIM_PLAY_PARMS.html'>dwSpeed</a> field in the data structure identified by lpPlay.
 
        LPMCI_ANIM_PLAY_PARMS lpPlay
            Specifies a far pointer to an MCI_ANIM_PLAY_PARMS data
            structure.

            Specifies a far pointer to an MCI_VD_PLAY_PARMS data
            structure.

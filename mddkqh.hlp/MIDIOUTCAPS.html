<b>MIDIOUTCAPS</b>
 
        The MIDIOUTCAPS structure describes the capabilities of a MIDI
        output device.
 
        typedef struct midioutcaps_tag {
            WORD wMid;
            WORD wPid;
            VERSION vDriverVersion;

            WORD wTechnology;
            WORD wVoices;

            WORD wChannelMask;
            DWORD dwSupport;
        } MIDIOUTCAPS;
 
<u>Fields</u>
        WORD wMid
            Specifies a manufacturer ID for the device driver for the
            MIDI output device. Manufacturer IDs are defined in
            <a href='mddk_manprodid.html'><span class='grhilite'>◄</span>Manufacturer and Product IDs<span class='grhilite'>►</span></a>.
 
        WORD wPid
            Specifies a product ID for the MIDI output device. Product
            IDs are defined in <a href='mddk_manprodid.html'><span class='grhilite'>◄</span>Manufacturer and Product IDs<span class='grhilite'>►</span></a>.
 
        VERSION vDriverVersion
            Specifies the version number of the device driver for the
            MIDI output device. The high-order byte is the major
            version number, and the low-order byte is the minor version
            number. The numbering is up to the developer but should
            change with each driver release.
 
        char szPname[MAXPNAMELEN]
            Specifies the product name in a NULL-terminated string.
 
        WORD wTechnology
            Describes the type of the MIDI output device according to
            one of the following flags:
 
            MOD_MIDIPORT
                Indicates the device is a MIDI hardware port.
 
            MOD_SQSYNTH
                Indicates the device is a square wave synthesizer.
 
            MOD_FMSYNTH
                Indicates the device is an FM synthesizer.
 
            MOD_MAPPER
                Indicates the device is the Microsoft MIDI Mapper.
 
        WORD wVoices
            Specifies the number of voices supported by an internal
            synthesizer device. If the device is a port, the field is
            not meaningful and should be set to 0.
 
        WORD wNotes
            Specifies the maximum number of simultaneous notes that
            may be played by an internal synthesizer device. If the
            device is a port, the field is not meaningful and should
            be set to 0.
 
        WORD wChannelMask
            Specifies the channels that an internal synthesizer device
            responds to, where the least significant bit refers to
            channel 0 and the most significant bit to channel 15. Port
            devices transmit on all channels and so should set this
            field to 0xFFFF.
 
        DWORD dwSupport
            Specifies optional functionality supported by the device.
 
            MIDICAPS_VOLUME
                Supports volume control.
 
            MIDICAPS_LRVOLUME
                Supports separate left and right volume control.
 
            MIDICAPS_CACHE
                Supports patch caching.
 
<u>Comments</u>
        If a device supports volume changes, the MIDICAPS_VOLUME flag
        should be set for the dwSupport field. If a device supports
        separate volume changes on the left and right channels, both the
        MIDICAPS_VOLUME and the MIDICAPS_LRVOLUME flags should be set for
        this field.

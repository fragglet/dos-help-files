    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

  Argument
 
    pathname    String expression representing a file name
 
  Returns
 
    PathStr     Fully qualified DOS path name
 
  Description
 
    The FExpand function expands a file name to a fully qualified DOS
    path name. The return value is a string that contains a drive
    designator and a root-relative path name. Both the argument and
    the returned string must be of type PathStr as defined in the
    Dos unit.
 
    FExpand uses the following rules to build the returned path
    string:
 
        If pathname is a null (empty) string, FExpand returns the
        current drive and directory.
 
        If the pathname includes a letter designating a drive,
        FExpand includes that designator in the returned path string.
        Otherwise, it uses the current drive designator in the returned
        string.
 
        If pathname includes a directory path, FExpand includes the
        root-relative equivalent of that directory path in the returned
        path string. Otherwise, it uses the current directory path in
        root-relative form. It converts shorthand directory notation
        '.' and '..' to the directories they represent.
 
        If pathname is complete (drive designator, root-relative
        directory path, and file name), FExpand returns that path name.
 
        FExpand returns the path string in upper case.
 
    Use the FSplit procedure to separate the returned path name to a
    drive, directory, file name, and extension.

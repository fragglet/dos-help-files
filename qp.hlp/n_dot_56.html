    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<div class="page-title"> Too many entries in list</div>
<pre>  The list being displayed contains too many entries to
  display all of them.
 
  The memory used to display lists is allocated dynami-
  cally. If you reduce the memory demands on QuickPascal,
  you can resolve this error. If you have many watch
  values, try removing some. If you keep a large number of
  files in a directory that you want to display in a list
  box, try removing unused files from the directory.

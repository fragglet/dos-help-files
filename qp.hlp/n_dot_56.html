  The list being displayed contains too many entries to
  display all of them.
 
  The memory used to display lists is allocated dynami-
  cally. If you reduce the memory demands on QuickPascal,
  you can resolve this error. If you have many watch
  values, try removing some. If you keep a large number of
  files in a directory that you want to display in a list
  box, try removing unused files from the directory.

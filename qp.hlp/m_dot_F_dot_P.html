<pre> 
  Use the Print command to get a hard copy of an entire
  file or selected text from any window. The Print command
  sends the text to the printer connected to the DOS port
  named LPT1. Make sure a printer is attached to this
  port, is turned on, and is on line.
 
  TIP: Use the Print command to print parts of the QP
  Advisor that are of special interest to you.

<pre>  QuickPascal could not alter a file that has its read-
  only attribute set. If you want to edit it anyway, try
  one of the following methods:
 
  ■ Use the Read Only command in the Edit menu to turn off
    the current window's read-only attribute. You can edit
    the file once it's off; however, the file's read-only
    attribute is still on. To retain your edits, use the
    Save As command in the File menu and save the file to
    a new name.
 
  ■ Use the DOS Shell command in the File menu to open a
    shell to DOS. Now, use the MS-DOS ATTRIB command to
    turn the file's read-only attribute off. Type EXIT to
    return to QuickPascal from the shell.

<pre>  The current program is too large to execute from within
  the QuickPascal environment. This can occur if you create
  a large program with the QPL command line and then debug
  or run it within the environment.
 
  Consider breaking the program into modules that you can
  test and refine separately, before combining them into
  one large program.

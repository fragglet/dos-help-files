    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>  The current program is too large to execute from within
  the QuickPascal environment. This can occur if you create
  a large program with the QPL command line and then debug
  or run it within the environment.
 
  Consider breaking the program into modules that you can
  test and refine separately, before combining them into
  one large program.

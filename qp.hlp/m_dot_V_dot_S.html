<pre> 
  Use the Size command to size a window. After choosing
  Size, you can resize the window with either the arrow
  keys or the mouse. The shortcut key is CTRL+F8. If you
  use a mouse, the window will shrink or grow as you move
  the mouse or as you drag the size box in the lower-right
  corner of the window.
 
  The new size is highlighted as you shrink or expand the
  window. Press ENTER when the window is the desired size,
  or press ESC to cancel sizing.

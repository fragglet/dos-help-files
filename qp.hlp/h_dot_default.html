  Features of Help
 
    The QuickPascal Advisor is more than just an on-line reference
    source. In addition to providing information about the QuickPascal
    language and environment, it also supports a variety of features
    that can make you a better and more efficient programmer:
 
      ■ You can paste complete example programs from the on-line
        help into QuickPascal and compile and run them.
      ■ You can get additional information on error messages that you
        might not understand
      ■ You can search through a help screen for a specific phrase.
      ■ You can print out portions or complete help screens for
        hard copy reference
 
    Most of QuickPascal's text commands work with the on-line help.
    For example, to copy a portion of a sample program, simply select
    the text from the help window, copy it, and paste it into the
    source window. Remember that the help window is read-only. In
    other words, you may copy, search, or print out information from
    the help window, but you can't add, change, or delete text found
    in the window.
 
  How to Use Help
 
    Press F1 on a Help Topic
    ════════════════════════
    QuickPascal keeps track of the cursor position. The position
    determines the help topic. For example, if you're in a dialog box,
    help on the dialog box appears. If the cursor is on a Pascal
    function and you press F1, help on that Pascal function appears.
 
    Click the Right Mouse Button on a Help Topic
    ════════════════════════════════════════════
    The Right mouse button is an alternative to F1. To use the Right
    mouse button, you must first enable it. Choose the Context
    Sensitive Help button from the Mouse item on the Options menu. Once
    the Right button is enabled, just click on a help topic. The Left
    mouse button is used for editing functions and menu selections as
    before.
 
    Maximizing and Closing the Help Window
    ══════════════════════════════════════
    To maximize the help window, press CTRL+F10 or click on the
    Maximize button in the upper-right corner of the help window. To
    close the help window at any time, press CTRL+F4 (if you're in
    language help) or ESC (if you're in menu help). You can also close
    the help window in language help by clicking on the Close button
    in the upper-left corner of the help window. (All window
    operations are done with the Left mouse button.) The cursor is
    then active at the position in your program at which you
    requested help.
 
  The Four Kinds of Help
 
      ■ Pascal language and unit help
      ■ QuickPascal menu and dialog box help
      ■ QuickPascal error help
      ■ Your own help──Notes
 
    There is also a help menu that gives you direct access to an
    index, contents screen, and this Help on Help screen. In addition,
    Help on Help is available at any time by pressing SHIFT+F10.
 
    Pascal Language and Unit Help
    ═════════════════════════════
    This help appears at the top or bottom of your screen in a
    scrollable, read-only window. (The help window appears at the top
    of your screen if you request help from the lower half, and at
    the bottom if you request help from the upper half.)
 
    Use the buttons at the top of the help window to explore other
    help information, such as example programs. Use the mouse, TAB
    key, or the regular cursor-positioning keys, such as the arrow
    keys, to move around individual topics in help. Use the regular
    editing functions to copy and paste sample programs from the help
    window.  Close the help window with the Close command in the View
    menu, with CTRL+F4, or by clicking the mouse button in the close
    box in the upper-left corner of the window.
 
    QuickPascal Menu and Dialog Box Help
    ════════════════════════════════════
    This help appears in a dialog box on your screen. Use the PgUp and
    PgDn keys to move between dialog box screens. You can close a menu
    by selecting the &lt;OK&gt; button or with the ESC key.
 
    QuickPascal Error Help
    ══════════════════════
    When QuickPascal encounters a compiler, linker, or run-time error,
    a dialog box appears on your screen. Select the &lt;Help&gt; button to
    display a comprehensive explanation of the error.
 
    Your Own Help
    ═════════════
    You can also add your own information to the QP Advisor. The
    NOTES.HLP is a help file that appears in the help window whenever
    you press a &lt;Notes&gt; button. You can add information with any
    editor. Select the &lt;Notes&gt; button on the Contents, Index, or
    the QuickPascal Keys screen for information about creating your own
    help.

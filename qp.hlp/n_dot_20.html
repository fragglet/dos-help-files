<pre>  Determine if the file being loaded is text file. If it
  is a text file, then it contains a carriage-return
  character that's not followed by a line-feed character.
 
  To repair the damaged text file, compile the CRLF.PAS
  utility that comes with QuickPascal and pass the damaged
  file through the resulting executable file. Once
  CRLF.EXE exists, enter CRLF on the DOS command line to
  display the required command syntax.

  Arguments
 
    source         Expression representing the initial location for
                   copying from memory
 
    destination    Expression representing the initial location for
                   writing to memory
 
    size           Word expression representing the number of bytes of
                   memory to be copied
 
  Description
 
    The Move procedure copies a specified number of bytes from one
    block of memory to another. Move leaves the block undisturbed,
    unless part of it also lies in the destination section. It does no
    range checking. Move is a quick way to transfer data within memory.
 
    Move reads the data to be copied from a block of memory beginning
    at the first byte of the source argument. It writes the data into
    memory beginning at the first byte of the destination argument.
    Because Move treats each of the source and destination arguments
    as the initial location of a contiguous sequence of bytes, it can
    operate on any type.
 
    The source and destination blocks may overlap. Move copies
    overlapping blocks correctly.
 
    The source and destination arguments may be of different types.
    Either source or destination may be given as a location within an
    array. To specify an area of memory beginning at a given array
    element, pass the indexed array to Move.
 
    Because Move does not perform range checking, it is possible to
    write beyond the boundary of the specified variable. Avoid this by
    using the SizeOf function to specify the size argument.
 
    Move operates more efficiently than a loop for copying parts of
    arrays.

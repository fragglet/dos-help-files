<pre> 
  Use the Step Over command to single-step through your
  code without entering each function or procedure. The
  shortcut key is F10.
 
  Step Over is useful when you know that a routine works
  correctly. As you step through the code, you can press
  F10 to step from the routine call to the next line after
  the routine, treating the procedure or function as a
  single statement.

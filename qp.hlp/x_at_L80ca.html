    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

  Argument
 
    file_variable    Text file; must be previously assigned
 
  Description
 
    The Append procedure opens an existing text file and prepares it
    for the appending of new text. The new text is added to the
    existing contents of the file. The opened file is the disk file or
    device that has the file name previously associated with
    file_variable. Use the Assign procedure to associate a file name
    with file_variable.
 
    Append moves the current file position to the end of the file. The
    Eof function always returns True for the file.
 
    A file opened with Append is write-only. Write and Writeln are the
    only legal I/O operations to a write-only file.
 
    Append applies only to text files. To append to a typed or untyped
    file, Reset the file. Then move the current position to the end of
    the file by calling the Seek procedure or making repeated calls to
    the Read or BlockRead procedures.
 
    To refer to the standard file Output (file handle 1), call Assign
    with a null string argument and then Append the file.
 
    If the file ends with CTRL+Z (ASCII 26) or if CTRL+Z appears in the
    last 128-byte block of the file, Append sets the current file
    position so that output begins at the first CTRL+Z in that block.
    Subsequent output to the file overwrites the CTRL+Z.
 
    If the external file is already open, Append closes and then
    reopens the file.
 
    If no external file with the assigned name exists, an I/O error
    occurs.
 
    To prevent a program from halting with a run-time error when an I/O
    error occurs, turn off I/O checking with {$I-} and check the
    return value of the IOResult function.

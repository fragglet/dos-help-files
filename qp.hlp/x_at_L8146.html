    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

  Argument
 
    code    Integer expression representing the exit code to pass to
            the parent process or operating system
 
  Description
 
    The Keep procedure terminates a program but keeps it resident in
    memory as a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program. Call Keep at
    the end of the program.
 
    The code argument passes exit information from the terminated
    program to the program executing it or to the DOS environment. By
    convention, 0 means no error. However, it is up to the terminating
    program to establish a meaning for each error value.
 
    To ensure enough memory for later programs, use the {$M} directive
    at the beginning of the program. Since the entire program and all
    of its associated memory──data segment, stack segment, heap──are
    kept resident, set the stack and heap to the minimum settings
    needed.
 
    TSR programs are an advanced and unsupported programming
    technique. No other documentation is provided with QuickPascal.
    Do not run a TSR program within the QuickPascal environment.

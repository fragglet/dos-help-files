    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

  Argument
 
    hours         Word variable receiving hours in range 0..23
 
    minutes       Word variable receiving minutes in range 0..59
 
    seconds       Word variable receiving seconds in range 0..59
 
    hundredths    Word variable receiving hundredths of second in
                  range 0..99
 
  Description
 
    The GetTime procedure returns the current time kept by the
    operating system. GetTime works the same as the DOS command TIME
    when TIME is used to return the system time.
 
    The system time remains set until changed by rebooting, calling the
    SetTime procedure, or executing TIME. Neither SetTime nor TIME
    changes the time kept by a computer's hardware clock.
 
    The arguments receive the parts of the current setting for time in
    hours, minutes, seconds, and hundredths of a second.
 
    GetTime returns information only as accurate as the time kept by
    the system. For the system time to be correct, either the system
    must have an accurate hardware clock or the correct date and time
    must be set after every power-up.
 
    Regardless of the hardware, the accuracy of PC clocks is less than
    perfect, varying around one-quarter second. Therefore, the value
    returned in the hundredths argument is unlikely to be accurate.

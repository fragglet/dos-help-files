<pre>  QuickPascal could not find the .KEY file specified on
  the QP command line, or that .KEY file was in an
  incorrect format.
 
  Make sure you are specifying an existing .KEY file.
 
  If the .KEY file exists but still causes an error, copy
  a new version of the .KEY file from the QuickPascal
  distribution disks. Then restart QuickPascal and specify
  the .KEY file again.

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

  Argument
 
    frequency    Integer expression representing a frequency in hertz
                 (cycles per second)
 
  Description
 
    The Sound procedure generates a tone from the computer's speaker in
    a specified frequency. The frequency of the tone is approximate.
    The NoSound procedure turns off the tone.
 
    The tone remains on until turned off. Execution of code after the
    procedure does not stop the tone. Unless turned off, the tone
    continues after the end of the program.
 
    To control the duration of the tone, use the Delay procedure and
    the KeyPressed function.
 
    Use Sound and NoSound to produce a tone that differs in duration
    and frequency from the tone produced by writing the bell character
    to the screen:
 
       Write( Chr( 7 ) );
 
    The Sound procedure is designed for IBM PCs and compatibles.
    Results may differ on other machines.

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre> 
  This is an unusual message to receive. The operating
  system cannot run the program. Perhaps there isn't
  enough memory. Try to restart QuickPascal using the
  /SWAP:DISK option as follows:
 
    QP /SWAP:DISK
 
  The /SWAP:DISK option tells QuickPascal to store a
  temporary file that it uses on disk rather than keeping
  that file in memory. Note that the temporary file requires
  one megabyte of disk space.
 
  Alternatively, perhaps the executable file is corrupted;
  try recompiling the source file.

  This error occurs for one of two reasons:
 
  ■ You attempted the DOS Shell command from the File menu
    and QuickPascal can't find COMMAND.COM in the location
    specified in the COMPSPEC environment variable. Set
    COMPSPEC to the appropriate directory path.
 
  ■ You chose &lt;Yes&gt; from the "Not enough memory to debug,
    Execute anyway?" dialog box, and there is a problem
    with the executable program. Recompile the program to
    create a new executable.

<pre>  QuickPascal could not find the given file.
 
  Check that you included the complete path name to the
  file and that the correct path is set in the Environment
  command from the Options menu.
 
  This error can also occur if you create a new DOS shell
  and delete a referenced unit or an include file, then
  return to QuickPascal and try to rebuild. If this
  happened, find another copy of the missing file and copy
  it to the directory that contained the missing file.

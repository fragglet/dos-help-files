    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

  Returns
 
    Word    Two bytes, each holding exit information from the child
            process most recently terminated
 
  Description
 
    The DosExitCode function returns the exit code passed from a child
    process. It also returns other information about how the child
    process terminated. DosExitCode returns the information in two
    bytes.
 
    A child process run with the Exec procedure returns a code when it
    terminates. A process terminates either normally or by the Halt
    procedure. DosExitCode returns the termination code to the parent
    process.
 
    The low byte of the return value contains the exit code passed from
    a child process. By convention, a code value of 0 means no error.
    However, it is up to the child process to establish a meaning for
    each error value.
 
    The high byte of the return value contains one of the following
    codes, which indicate how the child process terminated:
 
      Code    Termination Condition
      ════    ═════════════════════════════
 
      0       Normal termination
      1       CTRL+C termination
      2       Termination by device error
      3       Termination by Keep procedure
 
    After a particular child process has terminated, DosExitCode can
    be used repeatedly to return the same exit code. However, the
    information applies to the most recent child process, and a
    subsequent child process may change the value returned by
    DosExitCode.

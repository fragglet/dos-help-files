  Use the DOS Shell command to leave QuickPascal
  temporarily so that you can use DOS commands for such
  tasks as deleting, copying, and renaming files.
 
  When you are done working in DOS, type Exit at the DOS
  prompt to return to QuickPascal.
 
  NOTE: Do not start any TSR programs, such as
  MSHERC.COM, while in DOS. Also, don't delete any files
  you worked on during this session or any QuickPascal
  files. Finally, do not restart QuickPascal from the
  DOS shell.

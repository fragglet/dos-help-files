<div class="page-title"> Cannot open swap file</div>
<pre>  This error occurs when the SWAP option is off, and
  there isn't enough disk space or expanded memory for
  the SWAP file. The SWAP file, whether it's located
  on disk or in memory, requires one megabyte of memory.
 
  Possible solutions are: 1) acquire more disk space and
  restart QuickPascal using the /SWAP:DISK command-line
  option, 2) acquire more memory──close windows, remove
  TSRs, make sure you're not running QuickPascal from a
  shell, or 3) acquire expanded memory and start
  QuickPascal using the /SWAP:EMS command-line option.

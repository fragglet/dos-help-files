  A runtime error has occurred. Check that you've
  correctly allocated memory for all dynamic data
  structures. Also, use the {$R+} and {$R-} Range
  Checking compiler directives to check that array
  indexing, assignments, and parameter passing remain
  within their declared bounds. Don't forget to enable
  the Range Checking option in the Options.Compiler menu.

<pre> 
  Use the Animate command to highlight each statement as
  it is executed. Animation helps you understand the
  control flow of your program.  When animation is on,
  you can press CTRL+BREAK to stop execution.
 
  TIP: Control the speed of animation with the Animate
  Speed settings of the Run/Debug command in the Options
  menu.

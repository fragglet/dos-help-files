    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

  Arguments
 
    year       Word variable receiving year in range 1980..2009
 
    month      Word variable receiving month in range 1..12
 
    day        Word variable receiving day in range 1..31
 
    weekday    Word variable receiving day of week in range 0..6
 
  Description
 
    The GetDate procedure returns the current date kept by the
    operating system. GetDate works the same as the DOS command DATE
    when DATE is used to return the system date.
 
    The arguments receive the year, month, day, and weekday elements of
    the current setting for date.
 
    The weekday variable receives the numeric equivalent of the day of
    the week: Sunday=0, Monday=1, ..., Saturday=6.
 
    The system date remains set until changed by rebooting, executing
    DATE, or calling the SetDate procedure. Neither SetDate nor DATE
    changes the date kept by a computer's hardware clock.
 
    GetDate returns information only as accurate as the date kept by
    the system. For the system date to be correct, either the system
    must have an accurate hardware clock or the correct date and time
    must be set whenever the computer is turned on.

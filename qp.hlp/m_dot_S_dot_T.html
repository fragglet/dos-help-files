  Use the Toggle Tag command to set or clear a tag on
  the line the cursor is on. Set tags to mark lines that
  you frequently refer to in a window. Tagged lines are
  highlighted. When you no longer need a tag on a line,
  move the cursor to the tagged line and use the Toggle
  Tag command.
 
  Use the Next Tag and the Prev Tag commands in the
  Search menu to move from one tag to another. The Clear
  All Tags command will clear all tags from the active
  window.

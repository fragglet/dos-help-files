<pre>  Use the Topic command for help on a specific reserved
  word. The shortcut key is F1. A reserved word is a word
  whose use is predefined, such as a keyword, function
  name, or directive. Place the cursor anywhere on the
  reserved word that you want to look up, or on the space
  following it. The reserved word may be in your program
  or in a QuickPascal help file.
 
  QuickPascal displays the topic in the menu:
 
    Topic: xxxxxxxxxx   F1
               ▲
               └───── First 10 letters of topic to look up

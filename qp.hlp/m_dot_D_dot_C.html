  Use the Calls command to list the calls that led to the
  current statement. The most recently executed function
  or procedure is listed first.
 
  Choose any function or procedure from the list. The
  window that contains that function or procedure will be
  displayed in a file window with the cursor at the
  location that follows the call to the chosen function
  or procedure.
 
  TIP: After you choose a routine, use the Continue To
  Cursor command in the Run menu to execute to the start
  of the function or procedure.

  Use the Paste command to copy text from the Clipboard to
  the active window. The shortcut key is SHIFT+INS.
 
  QuickPascal inserts the text in one of two places:
 
    ■ If any text in the active window is selected
      (highlighted), QuickPascal deletes it and replaces
      it with the text from the Clipboard.
    ■ If no text is selected, the text from the Clipboard
      is inserted to the left of the cursor.
 
  WARNING: When pasted-in text replaces selected text,
  the selected text is deleted. QuickPascal does not save
  the selected text in the Clipboard.

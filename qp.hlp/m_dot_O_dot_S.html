  The Short Menus command switches the environment from
  full to short menus.
 
    ■ Short menus provide a simplified environment that
      is suitable for learning important commands quickly.
      You can use short menus to get started with
      QuickPascal and to develop single-module programs.
 
    ■ Full menus provide access to all features, including
      advanced debugging and program list options.

<pre>  There is not enough memory for QuickPascal. Check that
  you are not running QuickPascal from a shell──using the
  DOS Shell command in the File menu. If that isn't the
  problem, try to restart QuickPascal using the /SWAP:DISK
  option as follows:
 
    QP /SWAP:DISK
 
  The /SWAP:DISK option tells QuickPascal to store a
  temporary file that it uses on disk rather than keeping
  that file in memory. Note that the temporary file requires
  one megabyte of disk space.

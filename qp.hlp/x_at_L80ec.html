    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

  Arguments
 
    source    String variable to be modified
 
    index     Integer expression in the range 1..255 for beginning
              position in source
 
    size      Integer expression for a number of characters to be
              deleted
 
  Description
 
    The Delete procedure modifies a source string by removing a
    substring. The substring begins at the index position of source and
    continues for size characters.
 
    If index is greater than the length of source, Delete removes no
    characters.
 
    If the length of the substring as specified by size would extend
    beyond the end of the source string, Delete removes only the
    available characters from index to the end of the source.
 
    To delete from the beginning of a string, give the index argument as
    1, as in
 
       Delete( source, 1, size );

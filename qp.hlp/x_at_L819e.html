    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

  Arguments
 
    hours         Word expression representing hours in range 0..23
 
    minutes       Word expression representing minutes in range
                  0..59
 
    seconds       Word expression representing seconds in range
                  0..59
 
    hundredths    Word expression representing hundredths of a second
                  in range 0..99
 
  Description
 
    The SetTime procedure sets the current system time to a specified
    time. SetTime works the same as the DOS command TIME when TIME is
    used to set the system time.
 
    The system time remains set until changed by rebooting, calling the
    SetTime procedure again, or executing TIME. The new time setting
    lasts beyond the end of execution of the current program. Neither
    SetTime nor TIME changes the time kept by a computer's hardware
    clock.
 
    The arguments pass the hours, minutes, seconds, and hundredths of a
    second parts of the time setting. If any argument is invalid, such
    as a value out of range, the entire request is ignored.
 
    Regardless of the hardware, the accuracy of PC clocks is less than
    perfect, varying around one-quarter of a second. Thus, changes
    passed in the hundredths argument are not likely to be accurate.

  Use the Restart command to reset execution to the first
  line of the program. The shortcut key is SHIFT+F5. This
  command reloads the program into memory and discards the
  current values of all variables. You may use the Restart
  command any time execution has stopped (for example, at
  a breakpoint, while single-stepping, or when normal
  execution is complete).
 
  Restart does not execute your program.  You must use the
  Go, Continue To Cursor, Trace Into, or Step Over
  commands to actually restart execution. Breakpoints
  and watch values still apply after restarting.

  Use the Go command to start or continue execution. The
  shortcut key is F5. If the program has changed since you
  last ran it, QuickPascal asks whether you wish to
  rebuild the main file.
 
  Execution proceeds from the current statement until
 
    ■ A breakpoint is reached
    ■ The end of the program is reached
    ■ Execution is interrupted with CTRL+BREAK

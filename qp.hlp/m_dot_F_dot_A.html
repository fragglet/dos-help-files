<pre> 
  Use the Save As command to give the current file a name
  and copy it to disk.
 
  With the Save As command, you can avoid overwriting the
  previous version of the file by renaming the newer,
  changed version.
 
  You can continue to work on a file you have just saved;
  it remains open.

  QuickPascal assumes you are working on Pascal source
  code, so it uses the extension .PAS if you do not type
  one. To name the file with another extension, or with no
  extension, explicitly enter the file name as shown.
 
  If you type:     QuickPascal names the file:
 
    MYFILE           MYFILE.PAS
    MYFILE.PAS       MYFILE.PAS
    MYFILE.          MYFILE.

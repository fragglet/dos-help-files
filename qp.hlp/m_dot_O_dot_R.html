<pre> 
  Use the Run/Debug command to control screen activity
  during execution. Animate Speed sets the speed at which
  QuickPascal traces and swaps the screen when you are
  using the Animate command in the Run menu. Screen Swap
  controls when QuickPascal swaps from the environment to
  the output screen as your program runs.
 
    ■ Auto   Swaps screens for both input and output
    ■ On     Swaps on every executable statement and
             should be used with programs calling mouse or
             BIOS video services
    ■ Off    Turns off screen swapping

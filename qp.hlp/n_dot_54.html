    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>  An attempt was made to alter a read-only file. Use one
  of the following procedures to edit a read-only file:
 
  ■ Use the Read Only command in the Edit menu to turn off
    the current window's read-only attribute. You can edit
    the file once it's off; however, the file's read-only
    attribute is still on. To retain your edits, use the
    Save As command in the File menu and save the file to
    a new name.
 
  ■ Use the DOS Shell command in the File menu to open a
    shell to DOS. Then use the MS-DOS ATTRIB command to
    turn the file's read-only attribute off. Type EXIT to
    return to QuickPascal from the shell.

  Use the Move command to move the active window to a new
  location. After choosing Move, you can reposition the
  window with either the arrow keys or the mouse. If you
  use a mouse, the window will move as you move the mouse
  or as you drag the title bar of the window.
 
  The new location is highlighted as you move the window.
  Press ENTER or the Left mouse button when the window is
  where you want it, or press ESC to cancel the move.

  Use the Close command to close the active window. If the
  active window is a file window and has not been saved
  since changes were made, you will be asked if you want
  to save the file. The shortcut key is CTRL+F4.
 
  If you have a mouse, you can close a window by clicking
  in the close box in the upper-left corner of the window.

<pre>  You attempted one of the following:
 
  ■ You tried to load a file that is larger than 64K
    or contains more than 13310 lines.
 
  ■ You tried to add to an existing file, making it
    larger than 64K or 13310 lines.
 
  To overcome the problem, break the file into smaller
  pieces; put some procedures and functions into a custom
  unit. Remove unnecessary or duplicate sections of the
  program.

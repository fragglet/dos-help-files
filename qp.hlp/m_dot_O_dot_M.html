  Use the Mouse command to define the action of the Right
  mouse button.
 
    ■ Context Sensitive Help brings up help on the word or
      phrase in the source file where you click.
 
    ■ Continue To Cursor executes your compiled program
      as far as the line that currently has the cursor.
 
  When you select Continue To Cursor as the command for
  the Right mouse button, on-line help is still available
  if you press the combination of SHIFT and the Right
  mouse button.

<pre> 
  Use the Repeat Last Find command to repeat a search
  without retyping the previous search pattern.
 
  Repeat Last Find uses the same search string as the
  most recently executed Find or Change command.
 
  If no Find or Change command has been executed since
  you started QuickPascal, Repeat Last Find searches for
  the word at the cursor position. If the cursor is not
  on a word, the word to the left of the cursor becomes
  the target.

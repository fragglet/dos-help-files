    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

  Return
 
    Word    Address value stored in CS, DS, SS, or SP register
 
  Description
 
    The CSeg, DSeg, SSeg, and SPtr functions return the current value
    from the segment registers CS, DS, and SS, and stack-pointer
    register SP, respectively. The functions require no arguments.
 
    The values returned are addresses of type word.
 
    The CS register holds the 16-bit base address of the current code
    segment. The code segment stores the main program and procedures
    and functions. Because a program and its units occupy separate
    segments, this value may vary throughout the execution of the
    program. The value returned by CSeg depends on the part of the
    code which made the call to CSeg.
 
    The DS register holds the 16-bit base address of the data segment.
    The data segment stores program and unit global variables. Because
    a program has only one data segment, this value remains the same
    throughout the execution of the program.
 
    The SS register holds the 16-bit base address of the stack. The
    stack stores local variables and information for procedure or
    function calls. This segment value remains the same throughout the
    execution of the program.
 
    The SP register holds the current processor stack pointer, a 16-bit
    offset address pointing to the top of the stack. The stack stores
    local variables and procedure or function call information. The
    stack grows downward, meaning that the offset held in SP decreases
    as stack space is used.

<b> PICEM Views .PCX, .PIC, .GIF Files, and Saves in BSAVE Format</b> - Q66359
 
 The PICEM.EXE freeware program allows you to convert .PIC, .PCX, and
 .GIF graphics image files into the BSAVE/BLOAD format used by
 Microsoft Visual Basic version 1.0 for MS-DOS, as well as into the
 .PIC, .PCX, .GIF, and .IMG file formats. PICEM.EXE is a useful tool
 for converting graphics between different file formats.
 
 PICEM.EXE is available in the IBM Forum on <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='x_dot_compu.html'>CompuServe</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>, or in the
 Microsoft Software/Data Library on CompuServe, as described below.
 (For more information on CompuServe, call 800-848-8199.) Since
 PICEM.EXE is freeware, it is also widely available on local bulletin
 board services around the country.
 
 More Information:
 
 To find PICEM on the IBM Forum on CompuServe, type "GO IBMFF" to
 invoke IBM File Finder, and then follow the prompts to find PICEM.ARC
 or PICEM.EXE. Because you may find several older versions of PICEM,
 use only version 2.0b or 2.1 to support saving in Basic BLOAD format
 (or any later versions that support Basic BLOAD format). The following
 is the header information for PICEM in CompuServe:
 
    PICEM  - Picture view utility
             Version 2.1 - July 25, 1990
             Written by John Bridges,  Copyright(C) 1987,88,89,90
 
 PICEM can also be found in the Microsoft Software/Data Library on
 Compuserve by searching on the word PICEM or S12734. (PICEM was
 archived using the PKware file-conversion utility.)
 
 For any questions or problems regarding PICEM, contact John Bridges on
 CIS (CompuServe) ID:73307,606 in the PICS Forum. To enter the PICS
 forum on CompuServe, type "GO PICS" (without the quotation marks) from
 any prompt. (Since PICEM is not a Microsoft product, Microsoft does
 not support questions about PICEM.)
 
 If PICEM.EXE does not work properly on your card, you need to tell it
 what mode to use via the PICEM /V: switch. See the /V: modes listed in
 PICEM.DOC.
 
 Example 1:  Listed in Example 1 is a simple example of using PICEM
 version 2.1.   <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='x_dot_Q66359EX1.html'>See Example 1</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
 Example 2:  Listed in Example 2 is a more complicated way to save
 a picture in BSAVE/BLOAD format (as an alternative in case PICEM does
 not create the correct BSAVE format).   <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='x_dot_Q66359EX2.html'>See Example 2</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>

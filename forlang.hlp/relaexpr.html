─────Relational Expressions─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
     Relational expressions compare the values of two arithmetic
     expressions.
 
     An arithmetic expression can be compared with a character
     expression. The arithmetic expression is treated as if it were a
     character expression (a sequence of byte values).
 
     A relational expression produces a result of type LOGICAL (.TRUE.
     or .FALSE.).
 
     Relational Operators

     .LT.            Less than
 
     .LE.            Less than or equal to
 
     .EQ.            Equal to
 
     .NE.            Not equal to
 
     .GT.            Greater than
 
     .GE.            Greater than or equal to
 
     All relational operators are binary operators and appear between
     their operands.
 
     Relational expressions with character operands compare the position
     of their operands in the ASCII collating sequence.

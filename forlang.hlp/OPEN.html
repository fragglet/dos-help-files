     If UNIT= is omitted, &lt;unitspec&gt; must be the first parameter. The
     parameters can otherwise appear in any order.
 
     Parameter       Description
 
     unitspec        An integer expression specifying an external unit.
 
     access          A character expression indicating file access type.
                     Valid types are 'APPEND', 'DIRECT', or 'SEQUENTIAL'
                     (default).
 
     blanks          A character expression indicating how to handle
                     blanks. Valid values are 'NULL' or 'ZERO'. 'NULL'
                     (default) ignores blanks; 'ZERO' treats blanks as
                     zeros.
 
     blocksize       An integer expression specifying internal buffer
                     size for the unit.
 
     errlabel        The label of an executable statement in the same
                     program unit. An I/O error causes transfer of
                     control to the statement at &lt;errlabel&gt;. If
                     &lt;errlabel&gt; is omitted, the effect of an I/O error
                     is determined by the presence or absence of
                     &lt;iocheck&gt;.
 
     file            A character expression for the name of the file to
                     open. If FILE is omitted, the compiler creates a
                     scratch file that is deleted when closed or when the
                     program terminates normally.
 
                     If the file name is blank (FILE=' '), the compiler
                     draws names from the program's command line or
                     prompts the user for a file name.
 
                     If the file name is 'USER' (FILE='USER') and
                     the source file is compiled as a QuickWin
                     application, the unit is connected to a child
                     window. Files opened with FILE='USER' can
                     only specify the same attributes as units
                     connected to the screen or keyboard.
 
     focus           A logical value. If the value is .TRUE., the
                     child window receives focus prior to each
                     READ or WRITE to that unit.
 
     form            A character expression indicating the file's
                     formatting. Valid formats are: 'FORMATTED',
                     'UNFORMATTED', or 'BINARY'.
 
                     If access is sequential, the default for &lt;form&gt; is
                     'FORMATTED'; if access is direct, the default is
                     'UNFORMATTED'.
 
     iocheck         An integer variable that returns zero if no error
                     occurs, -1 if end-of-file is encountered, or the
                     error number if an error occurs.
 
     iofocus         A logical expression specifying whether a new
                     QuickWin child window will have the current I/O
                     focus (i.e. is the active window). By default,
                     &lt;iofocus&gt; is .TRUE.
 
     mode            A character expression for the file mode. Valid
                     modes are 'READ', 'WRITE', or 'READWRITE' (default).
 
     recl            An integer expression specifying the length of each
                     record in bytes. Required for direct-access files,
                     and ignored for sequential files.
 
     share           A character expression for the file-sharing status
                     for files on multiuser systems. Valid status values
                     are:
 
                     'COMPAT'   Compatibility mode allows the current
                                user to open multiple copies of the
                                file but locks out all other users
                                (DOS default mode). A file already
                                open in another mode cannot be
                                opened again in this mode.
 
                     'DENYRW'   Denies all other reading or writing
                                access while the file is open. No other
                                process may open the file.
 
                     'DENYWR'   Denies all other writing access while
                                the file is open.
 
                     'DENYRD'   Denies all other reading access while
                                the file is open.
 
                     'DENYNONE' Allows all other forms of access except
                                'COMPAT' (DENYNONE is the OS/2 default
                                mode).
 
     status          A character expression for the file's status. Valid
                     file status values are:
 
                     'OLD'      The file already exists.
 
                     'NEW'      The file does not exist.
 
                     'SCRATCH'  The file is temporary. Scratch files
                                are automatically deleted when closed.
 
                     'UNKNOWN'  The run-time system first attempts
                                to open the file as 'OLD', then as
                                'NEW'. If the file exists, it is
                                opened; if it does not exist, it is
                                created.
 
                     These status values affect only disk files. They
                     are ignored when opening physical devices.
 
     title           A character expression that specifies a child
                     window's title. The expression can be a
                     variable or a constant.
 
     Remarks
 
     Opening a file for unit* has no effect.
 
     Opening a file with a unit already connected to another file
     causes the open file to close and the new file name to be
     connected to the unit.
 
     If a parameter of the OPEN statement is an expression that calls
     a function, that function must not cause an I/O statement or the
     EOF intrinsic function. Calling these functions causes
     unpredictable results.
 
     Examples
 
     The following example opens a new file:
 
     C     Prompt user for a file name and read it:
           CHARACTER*64 filename
           WRITE (*, '(A\)') ' enter file name '
           READ  (*, '(A)') filename
     C     Open the file for formatted sequential access as unit 7.
     C     Note that the specified access need not have been specified,
     C     since it is the default (as is "formatted").
           OPEN (7, FILE = filename, ACCESS = 'SEQUENTIAL',
         +      STATUS = 'NEW')
 
     The following example opens an existing file:
 
     C     Open a file created by an editor, "DATA3.TXT", as unit 3:
           OPEN (3, FILE = 'DATA3.TXT')

─────Keeping Child Windows Open─────────────────────────────────────────────
 
     If a QuickWin application uses STATUS = 'KEEP' when closing a unit
     associated with a child window, the associated window remains open
     when the file is closed, but no further input or output is
     permitted.
 
     Also, the Close command is added to the child window's menu, and
     the string '- Closed' is appended to the window title when the file
     is closed with STATUS = 'KEEP'.
 
     NOTE: A window closed with STATUS = 'KEEP' is counted among the
     20 child windows available for QuickWin applications. The window is
     no longer counted when the user closes it, using the Close menu
     item on the child window.

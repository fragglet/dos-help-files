    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

     Statement       Purpose
 
     ALLOCATE        Dynamically establishes allocatable array
                     dimensions
 
     CALL            Executes a subroutine
 
     CASE            Within a SELECT CASE structure, marks a
                     block of statements that are executed if an
                     associated value matches the SELECT CASE
                     expression
 
     CONTINUE        Has no effect; often used as target of GOTO or
                     as the terminal statement in a DO loop
 
     CYCLE           Advances control to the end statement of a DO
                     loop; the intervening loop statements are not
                     executed
 
     DEALLOCATE      Frees the storage space previously reserved in
                     an ALLOCATE statement
 
     DO              Evaluates statements in the DO loop, through
                     and including the ending statement, a specific
                     number of times
 
     DO WHILE        Evaluates statements in the DO WHILE loop,
                     through and including the ending statement, until a
                     lgocial condition becomes false
 
     ELSE            Introduces an ELSE block
 
     ELSE IF         Introduces an ELSE IF block
 
     END             Ends execution of a program unit
 
     END DO          Marks the end of a series of statements following
                     a DO or DO WHILE statement
 
     END IF          Marks the end of a series of statements following
                     a block IF statement
 
     END SELECT      Marks the end of a SELECT CASE block
 
     EXIT            Leaves a DO loop; execution continues with
                     the first statement following the DO loop
 
     GOTO            Transfers control to another part of the program
 
     INCLUDE         Inserts contents of a specified file into the
                     source file
 
     IF              Controls conditional execution of other
                     statement(s)
 
     PAUSE           Suspends program execution and, optionally,
                     executes operating-system commands
 
     RETURN          Returns control to the program unit that called a
                     subroutine or function
 
     SELECT CASE     Transfers program control to a selected block of
                     statements, based on value of a controlling
                     expression
 
     STOP            Terminates a program
                                    -♦-

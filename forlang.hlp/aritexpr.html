─────Arithmetic Expressions─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
     An arithmetic expression produces a value that is an integer, a
     real or complex number, or an array of those types. Basic operands
     used in arithmetic expressions are
 
     ■ Arithmetic constants or variables
 
     ■ Variables
 
     ■ Arrays or array elements
 
     ■ Function references
 
     Arithmetic expressions are built from basic operands and arithmetic
     operators.
 
     Arithmetic Operators
 
     Operator        Operation              Precedence
 
     **              Exponentiation         1 (highest)
 
     /               Division               2
 
     *               Multiplication         2
 
     -               Subtraction (binary)   3
                       or negative (unary
 
     +               Addition (binary) or   3
                      identity (unary)
 
     Arithmetic operators are binary operators, appearing between two
     operands. The plus and minus operators are also unary operators,
     which precede a single operand.
 
     When consecutive operations are of equal precedence, the leftmost
     operation is performed first except exponentiation. With two or
     more consecutive exponents, the rightmost operation is performed
     first.
 
     Integer Division
 
     Integer division returns the truncated quotient of the two
     operands.
 
     Sample results of integer divisions:
 
          -7/3 evaluates to 2
          9/10 evaluates to 0
          1/4 + 1/4 evaluates to 0
 
     Type Conversion of Arithmetic Operands
 
     When all operands of an arithmetic expression are of the same data
     type, the value returned by the expression is also of that type.
     When the operands are of different data types, the type of the
     value returned by the expression is the type of the highest-ranked
     operand.
 
     The exception to the rule is operations involving both REAL*8
     numbers and COMPLEX*8 numbers, which yield COMPLEX*16 results.
 
     Ranking of arithmetic operands:
 
     Operand                            Precedence
 
     DOUBLE COMPLEX or COMPLEX*16       1 (highest rank)
 
     COMPLEX[*8]                        2
 
     DOUBLE PRECISION or REAL*8         3
 
     REAL[*4]                           4
 
     INTEGER*4                          5
 
     INTEGER*2                          6
 
     INTEGER*1 (lowest rank)            7
 
     Example: An operation performed on an INTEGER*2 and a REAL*4, the
     INTEGER*2 operand is first converted to REAL*4. The result is a
     value of data type REAL*4.
 
     In an operation on a real number and a complex number, the real
     number is converted to a complex number, and the result is also
     complex.

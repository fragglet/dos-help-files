     NMAKE Fatal Error U1035
 
     syntax error : expected ':' or '=' separator
 
     Either a colon (:) or an equal sign (=) was expected.
 
     Possible causes include the following:
 
        ■ A target was not followed by a colon.
 
        ■ A single-letter target was followed by a colon and no space
          (such as a:). NMAKE interpreted it as a drive specification.
 
        ■ An inference rule was not followed by a colon.
 
        ■ A macro definition was not followed by an equal sign.
 
        ■ A character followed a backslash (\) that was used to
          continue a command to a new line.
 
        ■ A string appeared that did not follow any NMAKE syntax rule.
 
        ■ The makefile was formatted by a word processor.
                                    -♦-

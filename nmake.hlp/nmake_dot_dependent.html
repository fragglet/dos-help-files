─────NMAKE──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
     A description block begins with a dependency line that defines a
     dependency. A dependency line appears approximately as follows:
 
          targets : [dependents]
 
     A dependency specifies one or more target files and then lists
     zero or more dependent files. NMAKE evaluates dependencies by
     comparing time stamps of targets and dependents. If a target does
     not exist, or if its time stamp is earlier than that of any of its
     dependents, NMAKE executes the commands block for that target.
 
     Syntax Rules
 
     The dependency line must not be indented (it cannot start with a
     space or tab). The first target must be specified at the beginning
     of the line.
 
     Separate targets from dependents by a single colon (:). To specify
     a target in more than one dependency, use a double colon (::). The
     colon is preceded or followed by zero or more spaces or tabs.
     See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='x_at_L8022.html'>Targets in Multiple Dependencies</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
     The entire dependency must appear on one line; however, you can
     extend the line by placing a backslash (\) after a target or
     dependent and continuing the dependency on the next line.

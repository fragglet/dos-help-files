     The instructions to create the inline file begin on the first line
     after the command. The syntax to create the inline file is:
 
          inlinetext
          .
          .
          .
          &lt;&lt;[KEEP | NOKEEP]
 
     The set of angle brackets marking the end of the inline file must
     appear at the beginning of a separate line in the makefile. All
     &lt;inlinetext&gt; before the angle brackets is placed in the inline
     file. The text can contain macro expansions and substitutions.
     Directives and comments are not permitted in an inline file; NMAKE
     treats them as literal text. Spaces, tabs, and newline characters
     are treated literally.
 
     The inline file can be temporary or permanent. To retain the file
     after the end of the NMAKE session, specify KEEP immediately after
     the angle brackets. If you don't specify a preference, or if you
     specify NOKEEP (the default), the file is temporary. KEEP and
     NOKEEP are not case sensitive. The temporary file exists for the
     duration of the NMAKE session.
 
     It is possible to specify KEEP for a file that you do not name; in
     this case, the NMAKE-generated filename appears in the appropriate
     directory after the NMAKE session.

     Example
 
          COMMANDS = cls ^
          dir
          showdir :
            &lt;&lt;showdir.bat
          $(COMMANDS)
          &lt;&lt;
 
     This makefile uses a temporary inline file to clear the screen and
     then display the contents of the current directory. The name of
     the inline file serves as the only command in the description
     block. This command has the same effect as running a batch file
     named SHOWDIR.BAT that contains the same commands as those listed
     in the macro definition.

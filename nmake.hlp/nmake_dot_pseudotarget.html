    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

─────NMAKE──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
     A pseudotarget is specified as follows:
 
          pseudotarget :
            commands block
 
     A pseudotarget is a target that doesn't specify a file but instead
     names a label for use in executing a group of commands.
 
     NMAKE interprets the pseudotarget as a file that does not exist
     and thus is always out-of-date. When evaluating a dependency whose
     target is a pseudotarget, NMAKE always executes the commands.
 
     A pseudotarget name must follow filename syntax rules. However, if
     the name does not have an extension (that is, it does not contain
     a period), it can exceed the 8-character limit for filenames and
     can be up to 256 characters long. A pseudotarget name is not case
     sensitive. Be sure that the current directory does not contain a
     file with a name that matches the pseudotarget.
 
     Time Stamps and Pseudotargets
 
     NMAKE assumes that a pseudotarget used as a target has a time
     stamp equal to the most recent time stamp of all its dependents.
     If a pseudotarget has no dependents, the current time is assumed.
 
     When a pseudotarget is listed as a dependent, its assumed time
     stamp is evaluated. A pseudotarget used as a dependent must appear
     as a target in another dependency; however, that dependency does
     not need to have a commands block. A pseudotarget that is also
     used as a dependent appears as follows:
 
          targets : pseudotarget [other dependents]
            commands block
 
          pseudotarget :
            [commands block]
 
     Using a Pseudotarget
 
     You can use pseudotargets to build more than one target. NMAKE
     builds only command-line targets; if no command-line target is
     specified, it builds only the first target in the first dependency
     in the makefile. To build multiple targets without listing them on
     the command line, write a makefile with a dependency whose target
     is a pseudotarget and whose dependents are the targets you want to
     build. Either place this description block first in the makefile
     or specify the pseudotarget on the NMAKE command line.
 
     Example
 
          all : setenv project1.exe project2.exe
 
          project1.exe : project1.obj
            LINK project1;
 
          project2.exe : project2.obj
            LINK project2;
 
          setenv :
            set LIB=\project\lib
 
     This makefile builds both .EXE files if no target is specified on
     the command line (or if the pseudotarget all is specified). The
     pseudotarget setenv changes the LIB environment variable before
     the .EXE files are updated.

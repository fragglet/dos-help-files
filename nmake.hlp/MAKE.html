     Recursion macros let you use NMAKE to call NMAKE. These macros can
     make recursion more efficient.

     MAKE
          Defined as the name which you specified to the operating
          system when you ran NMAKE; this name is NMAKE unless you have
          renamed the utility file. Use this macro to call NMAKE
          recursively. The /N command-line option to prevent execution
          of commands does not prevent this command from executing. It
          is recommended that you do not redefine MAKE.
 
     MAKEDIR
          Defined as the current directory when NMAKE was called.
 
     MAKEFLAGS
          Defined as the options currently in effect. MAKEFLAGS is
          passed automatically with the $(MAKE) command. You cannot
          redefine MAKEFLAGS. To change the /D, /I, /N, and /S options
          within a makefile, use !CMDSWITCHES. To add other options,
          specify them as part of the recursion command.

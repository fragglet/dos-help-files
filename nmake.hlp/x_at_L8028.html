    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

     A command line must begin with one or more spaces or tabs. This
     indentation distinguishes between a dependency and a command.
 
     Blank lines cannot appear between the dependency line and the
     commands block. However, a line containing only spaces or tabs can
     appear; this line is interpreted as a null command, and no error
     occurs. Blank lines can appear between command lines.
 
     A command can be continued over more than one line if each line
     ends with a backslash (\). The backslash is interpreted as a
     space on the command line. A continued command must still be
     within the operating system's limit on the length of a command
     line. If the backslash is followed by another character, such as a
     space, NMAKE interprets the backslash and the trailing characters
     literally.For example, the following two commands are equivalent:
 
            link myapp\
          another, , NUL, mylib, myapp
            link myapp another, , NUL, mylib, myapp
 
     A single command can appear at the end of a dependency line,
     whether or not a commands block is specified. The syntax is:
 
          targets : [dependents] ; command
            [commands]
 
     A special syntax represents the filename of the first dependent.

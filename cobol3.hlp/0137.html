  Text:         Program collating sequence not defined
 
  Explanation:  You have included the PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE
                clause within the OBJECT-COMPUTER paragraph of your
                code but have failed to code a corresponding ALPHABET-NAME
                in the SPECIAL-NAMES paragraph.  Your code must contain an
                ALPHABET-NAME clause if it has a PROGRAM COLLATING SEQUENCE
                clause within it.
 
  Resolution:   Insert the necessary ALPHABET-NAME clause ensuring it
                has the same user-defined name as that used in the
                SEQUENCE entry. If you have specified both of these
                clauses in your code but have still received this
                message then ensure that you have used the same
                user-defined name in each and that it is spelled the
                same in both.  Correct any spelling error your code
                may contain.

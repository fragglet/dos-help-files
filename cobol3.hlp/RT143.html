  Text:         Rewrite/delete in sequential mode not preceded by
                successful read
 
  Severity:     Recoverable
 
  Explanation:  You have failed to do a successful read on a
                sequentially accessed file attempting a REwrite or DELETE
                on some of the information contained within that file.
 
  Resolution:   If the previous read was successful then perform a
                read on the relevant file before you retry the
                unsuccessful REWRITE or DELETE operation.  If the
                previous read was also unsuccessful close the file
                execute a STOP RUN statement and then recode your
                program before you next run it.

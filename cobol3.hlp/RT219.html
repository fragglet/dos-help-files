  Text:         Operating system shared file limit exceeded
 
  Severity:     Recoverable
 
  Explanation:  You have tried to exceed your operating system's limit
                on the number of shared files that you can have open
                simultaneously. As this figure is operating system
                dependent, you will need to consult your Release Notes
                for details of how many shared files your system
                permits to be open at any one time.
 
  Resolution:   Close some of the open shared files you are no longer
                accessing and retry the file operation.
                                    -♦-

  Message:      RT148
 
  Text:         Wrong open mode or access mode for write
 
  Severity:     Recoverable
 
  Explanation:  You have tried to write to a file in sequential access
                mode that you have not opened for OUTPUT or EXTEND, or
                you have tried to write to a file in random or dynamic
                access mode that has not been opened INPUT or I-O.
 
  Resolution:   Close the file and re-open it with the correct open
                mode for the file type. However, as this error implies that
                your program contains a mistake in its logic, you may want
                to close any files that are open, execute a STOP RUN
                statement and then recode.

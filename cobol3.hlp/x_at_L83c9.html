     ANSI'85 File Status
 
     If you are using the standard system loaded for ANSI'85
     operation, then ANSI'85 codes are produced by default. If the -A
     switch is used at run-time with a program compiled for ANSI'85
     operation, then ANSI'74 file status codes are produced.
 
 
     ANSI'74 File Status
 
     If you compile your program with the directive, NOANS85, then
     ANSI'74 file status codes are produced. If you do not specify
     NOANS85 when compiling, then ANSI'85 file status codes are produced.
     If you wish to use ANSI'85 syntax, but have ANSI'74 file status
     codes, then replace the NOANS85 directive with ANS85(SYNTAX), or
     remove the NOANS85 directive and use the -A switch at run-time.
 
 
     Extended File Status
 
     The ANSI'74 and ANSI'85 file status conventions described above are
     augmented with more detailed extended file status codes. Extended
     file status codes have the character "9" as the first byte of the
     file status. The second byte is a binary (COMP-X) number, which is
     equivalent to a run-time error number. These are written as 9/nnn
     where nnn is the binary number in the second byte. Run-time errors
     are documented in your Error Messages Manual.
 
     For example, if you are writing a file to disk and the disk runs out
     of space, the ANSI'74 file status would be a "30", which translates
     into a "Permanent error - no other information is available" error
     message. That error message is very general; a "permanent error"
     could mean that the disk has failed, or that the disk drive door is
     open. So, rather than return a generic file status, this COBOL
     system returns an extended file status of 9/007 (i.e. the character,
     "9", in the first byte, and binary 7 in the second) meaning "disk
     full".
 
     When using ANSI'74 or ANSI'85 file status codes, the run-time system
     returns extended status codes if the extended file status is more
     specific than what would normally be returned.
 
 
     Note:
 
     Unless otherwise specified, each file status code can be received
     for operations on any file organizations in any access mode.

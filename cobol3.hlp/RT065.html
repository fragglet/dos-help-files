  Message:      RT065
 
  Text:         File locked
 
  Severity:     Recoverable
 
  Explanation:  You have tried to open a file which has already been
                locked, or opened for output by another user.
                Alternatively, you have tried to lock or open for
                output a file which another user already has open.
 
  Resolution:   Your program can inform the system operator (if there
                is one) that it is unable to access this file and
                should wait until the other user has finished using
                the file and closes it.  You should then be able to
                continue to run your program.

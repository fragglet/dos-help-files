  Message:      RT014
 
  Text:         Too many files open simultaneously
 
  Severity:     Recoverable
 
  Explanation:  You have tried to exceed the maximum number of files
                which you can have open at any one time.  This may be
                a software or an operating system constraint, but you
                must not violate it.
 
  Resolution:   Close some of the open files which you are not
                currently accessing, and then try to open the relevant
                file again.  You should then be able to continue to
                run your program. Depending on your operating system,
                you may be able to increase the maximum number of
                files you are allowed to have open.

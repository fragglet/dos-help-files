  Text:         Error during chain (program not found)
 
  Severity:
 
  Explanation:  You have tried to chain to another program which your
                system is unable to find.
 
  Resolution:   Once your program has terminated you will need to copy
                the relevant file into your logged-in drive or
                directory.  If there is not sufficient space available
                to allow you to do this, then you will have to set the
                COBDIR environment variable to search the directory or
                drive on which the file is present when your program
                calls it. Refer to your COBOL System Reference for details
                of the COBDIR environment variable. Once you have taken
                these steps, run your program again.

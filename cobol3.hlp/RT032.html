  Text:         Too many indexed files, or no such process
 
  Severity:     Recoverable
 
  Explanation:  You have tried to open an indexed file but the number
                of files that you currently have open is the system
                limit.
 
                Alternatively, you could be trying to use a process id which
                does not exist, or which your operating system no longer
                recognizes.
 
 
  Resolution:   You will have to close some of the indexed files which
                you are no longer accessing, and you should then be
                able to open the file you require.
 
                In this case you must rewrite your code so that it uses a
                process id which your system recognizes.

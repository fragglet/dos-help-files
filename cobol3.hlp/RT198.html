  Text:         Load failure
 
  Severity:     Fatal
 
  Explanation:  The system cannot load a program, usually because
                there is insufficient memory.
 
                Alternatively your program has run out of memory during
                the loading or reloading of a file. This will occur more
                frequently during Animation because of the extra memory
                required during Animation.
 
  Resolution:   Make more memory available and then rerun your program.
 
                Ensure that as much memory as possible is available during
                Animation by CANCELing any program you do not currently
                need to access.

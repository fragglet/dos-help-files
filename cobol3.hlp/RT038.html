  Message:      RT038
 
  Text:         Disk not compatible
 
  Severity:     Fatal
 
  Explanation:  You have tried to load a disk that is incompatible
                with the current version of your operating system.
                This could be because it was created under a previous
                version of the system or it could have been created
                under a completely different operating system.  You
                would also receive this error if you tried to load a
                disk with a name that clashed with a disk that was
                already loaded.
 
  Resolution:   If the error is a result of a clash of names you can
                rename one of the disks and then you will be able to
                load both disks together if this is what you require.

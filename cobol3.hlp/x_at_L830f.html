     These messages are output by the Run-Time System, and so can be
     produced while you are compiling, animating, or running your
     program. Some are environment dependent, so your particular
     environment may not support them. This On-line Reference lists the
     text and severity of each message, explains the error or problem
     that causes the message, and gives advice on how to prevent it.
 
     There are two types of run-time error:
 
     Fatal         A message is sent to the screen and the program
                   terminates immediately.
 
     Recoverable.  The error is reported to the program. You can trap
                   these errors in your program, but often they are
                   the result of an error in your program's logic. If
                   the program does not trap the error a message is
                   sent to the screen and the program terminates
                   immediately.

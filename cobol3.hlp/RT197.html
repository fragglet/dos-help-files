  Text:         Screen handling system initialization error
 
  Severity:     Fatal
 
  Explanation:  This error may be caused by one of the
                following:
 
                 -  your display adapter is in the wrong mode
 
                 -  your screen handling interface has not been correctly
                    initialized  because your terminal does not have the
                    required capabilities
 
                 -  your terminfo file is corrupted
 
                 -  memory has been incorrectly allocated.
 
  Resolution:   If you are using a DOS or OS/2 system, the monitor
                must be in alphanumeric display mode rather than
                graphics display mode. You can set the display mode to
                a valid alphanumeric mode by using the DOS MODE
                utility and then rerunning your program.
 
                If you are using a UNIX-type system, you must check that
                your terminfo file contains the correct entry for your
                terminal. Refer to your COBOL System Reference for details.
                If your terminfo file is corrupt, or your screen handling
                interface has not been correctly initialized, you must
                advise your system administrator of the problem, and he
                will take steps to attempt to correct it. If your memory
                has been incorrectly allocated, you must rerun your program.

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

  Message:      RT165
 
  Text:         Version number incompatibility
 
  Severity:     Fatal
 
  Explanation:  You are using intermediate code which has been produced
                on a version of your COBOL system that is incompatible with
                the run-time system you are currently using. Your RTS,
                therefore, will not be able to execute correctly any
                generated code you are producing or have already produced
                from this intermediate code.
 
                Alternatively, you may have attempted to execute a file
                which is not your COBOL system's intermediate or generated
                code.
 
                Alternatively, you have attempted to execute an application
                using a version of the COBOL system component that is
                incompatible with the Run-Time System you are currently
                using.
 
                Alternatively, the COBOL system detected an incorrect
                version of the Run-Time System. If possible, the name of
                the component in question is displayed.
 
  Resolution:   If no component name is displayed, determine which
                component is in error by examining each COBOL system
                component required by your application. When you have
                established which component is at fault, reinstall it using
                your installation disks, then resubmit the application to
                your COBOL system.
 
                Note that if the incorrect component is a run-time support
                library, for example COBLIB.LIB, you need to relink your
                application before running.

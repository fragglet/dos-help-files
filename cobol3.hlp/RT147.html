  Message:      RT147
 
  Text:         Wrong open mode or access mode for read/start
 
  Severity:     Recoverable
 
  Explanation:  You have tried to carry out a read or START operation
                on a file which has not been opened for INPUT or I-O, or
                which is not open at all.
 
  Resolution:   Open the file for I-O or for INPUT and you should then
                be able to continue to run your program.  However, as this
                error implies that your program contains a mistake in its
                logic, you may want to close any files which are open,
                execute a STOP RUN statement and then recode.
                                    -♦-

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

 EXIT {DEF | DO | FOR | FUNCTION | SUB}
 
 Usage Notes
   ■ EXIT statements do not define the end of the structure in which they
     are used. EXIT statements provide only an alternative exit from the
     structure.
 
   ■ EXIT DEF causes an immediate exit from the executing DEF FN function.
     Program execution continues where the DEF FN function was invoked.
 
   ■ EXIT DO provides an alternative exit from a DO...LOOP. It can be used
     only inside a DO...LOOP statement; EXIT DO transfers control to the
     statement following the LOOP statement. When used within nested
     DO...LOOP statements, it transfers out of the immediately enclosing
     loop.
 
   ■ EXIT FOR provides another way to exit a FOR...NEXT loop. It can appear
     only in a FOR...NEXT loop; EXIT FOR transfers control to the statement
     following the NEXT statement. When used within nested FOR...NEXT loops,
     transfers out of the immediately enclosing loop.
 
   ■ EXIT FUNCTION causes an immediate exit from a FUNCTION procedure.
     Program execution continues where the FUNCTION was invoked. It can be
     used only in a FUNCTION procedure.
 
   ■ EXIT SUB immediately exits a SUB procedure. Program execution continues
     with the statement after the CALL statement. It can be used only in a
     SUB procedure.

 REDIM [PRESERVE] [SHARED] variable(subscripts) [AS type]
                         [,variable(subscripts) [AS type]]...
 
 Usage Notes
   ■ The REDIM statement is often used in the initial Form_Load event
     procedure to define the dimensions of an array shared between form
     modules. See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='../unknown.html#load'>Load Event</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
   ■ Although you can change the size of an array's dimensions with REDIM,
     you cannot change the number of dimensions. For example, the following
     statements are legal:
 
         DIM A(50,50)                  ' $DYNAMIC
         ERASE A
         REDIM A(20,15)                ' Array A still has two dimensions
 
     However, the following statements are illegal, and produce the error
     message, "Wrong number of dimensions":
 
         DIM A(50,50)                  ' $DYNAMIC
         ERASE A
         REDIM A(5,5,5)                ' Changed number of dimensions
                                       'from two to three
 
   ■ You can also use REDIM to declare or resize an array of user-defined
     types. In the following example, the variable Card is declared as a
     user-defined type; REDIM allocates space for an array called Deck that
     consists of 52 Card elements:
 
         TYPE Card
              Suit AS STRING * 9
              Value AS INTEGER
         END TYPE
 
         DIM Deck()
 
         REDIM Deck(1 TO 52) AS Card
 
     Note: The user-defined type declaration (using the TYPE statement) can
     only exist at the module level; REDIM statement can only be used in a
     module or procedure. See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='../unknown.html#type'>TYPE Statement</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>  <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='../unknown.html#.dtp.user'>User-Defined Data Types</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
   ■ If the PRESERVE keyword is not used, REDIM initializes all:
     • Elements of numeric arrays to zero
     • Elements of string arrays to null strings
     • Fields of record variables to zero, including fixed-length string
       elements
 
   ■ REDIM is used to size or resize a dynamic array that has already been
     formally declared using DIM with empty parentheses (no dimension
     subscripts).
 
   ■ If you first declare a dynamic array using a DIM statement and no
     dimension subscripts, the maximum number of dimensions you can later
     specify with REDIM is 8.
 
   ■ If your array requires more than 8 dimensions, you can use REDIM in a
     SUB or FUNCTION procedure to initially declare a local dynamic array
     variable; if this is the case, your array can have up to 60 dimensions.
 
   ■ When a REDIM statement is compiled, all arrays declared in the
     statement are treated as dynamic. At run time, when a REDIM statement
     is executed, the array is deallocated (if it is already allocated) and
     then reallocated with the new dimensions. Note: If the PRESERVE keyword
     is not used, old array element values are lost.
 
   ■ The PRESERVE keyword allows you to raise or lower the outer bounds of a
     dynamic array without erasing data. For example, the following
     statements keep any data entered in arrayX() and add space for more
     elements in the third dimension of the array:
 
         REDIM X(10, 10, 10)
         .
         .
         .
         REDIM PRESERVE X(10, 10, 15)
 
     The third dimension of X() is the rightmost bound of the array. To
     change the leftmost bound, you must compile the program with /R.

   ■ Use UBOUND after REDIM PRESERVE to determine how many filled elements
     there are in an array since they will all be filled.
     See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='../unknown.html#ubound'>UBOUND Function</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
   ■ When used with DIM, the SHARED keyword shares variables among all
     procedures in a module. In contrast, the SHARE statement shares
     variables between a single procedure and the module-level code.

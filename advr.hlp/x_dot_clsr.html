    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

 CLS [0 | 1 | 2]
 
 Usage Notes
   ■ If no object is specified, CLS behavior is determined by its location
     in code:
     • If CLS is used in a form module, it is a method, and applies to the
       default form. See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='../unknown.html#cls'>CLS Method</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
     • If CLS is in a non-form or code module, it is a statement, and applies
       to the entire screen.
 
   ■ If CLS is used as a statement (with the arguments 0, 1, or 2) when forms
     are showing, Visual Basic generates the error message, "Invalid
     when forms are showing."
 
   ■ To use the CLS statement with arguments 0, 1, or 2, you must first
     unload or hide any visible forms.
     See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='../unknown.html#hide'>HIDE Method</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>  <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='../unknown.html#.unloadm'>UNLOAD Statement</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
   ■ The behavior of a particular CLS statement depends on:
     • The CLS statement argument ( 0, 1, 2, or none).
     • The current screen mode.
     • Whether or not a VIEW statement has been executed that has changed the
       graphics viewport from the default of the entire screen.
     • Whether or not a VIEW PRINT statement has been executed that has
       established a user-defined text viewport.
     • Whether or not a KEY ON statement has been executed that has
       established the bottom text line as a list of function-key
       assignments. The bottom line on the screen may be 25, 30, 43, or 60,
       depending on the current screen mode.
 
   ■ The following conditions determine how the CLS statement works with
     graphics and text viewports:
     • Screen mode 0 has only a text viewport. All other screen modes have
       both a text and graphics viewport.
     • The default graphics viewport is the entire screen.
     • The default text viewport is the entire screen, except for the bottom
       line of text.
     • After a user-defined graphics viewport (or "clipping region") has been
       established by executing a VIEW statement, it is reset to the default
       by executing any of the following statements:
       ■ VIEW without arguments
       ■ CLEAR
       ■ Any SCREEN statement that changes the screen resolution
     See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='../unknown.html#.clearm'>CLEAR Statement</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>  <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='../unknown.html#.SCREENS'>SCREEN Statement</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>  <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='../unknown.html#view'>VIEW Statement</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
     • After a user-defined text viewport has been established by executing
       a VIEW PRINT statement, it is reset to the default by executing any of
       the following statements:
       ■ VIEW PRINT without arguments
       ■ Any text-oriented statement (such as WIDTH) that changes the number
         of text columns or text lines on the screen
     See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='../unknown.html#.vupri'>VIEW PRINT Statement</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>  <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='../unknown.html#.widths'>WIDTH Statement</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
     • If the KEY ON statement has been executed, CLS statement regenerates
       the bottom screen line as the function-key assignment list or as a
       line of blank characters.

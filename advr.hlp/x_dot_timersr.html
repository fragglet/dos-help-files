 TIMER {ON | OFF | STOP}
 
 Usage Notes
   ■ If your program contains event-handling statements and you are compiling
     from the BC command line, use the /W or /V option. If you do not use
     these options and your program contains event traps, Visual Basic
     generates the error message, "ON event without /V or /W on command
     line." See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='../unknown.html#.BC.EXE'>BC Command-Line Options</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
   ■ TIMER ON enables timer-event trapping. A timer event occurs when n&amp;
     seconds have elapsed (as specified in the ON TIMER statement). If a
     timer event occurs after a TIMER ON statement, the routine specified
     in the ON TIMER statement is executed.
 
   ■ TIMER OFF disables timer-event trapping. No timer-event trapping
     takes place until another TIMER ON statement is executed. Events
     occurring while trapping is off are ignored.
 
   ■ TIMER STOP suspends timer-event trapping. No trapping takes place
     until another TIMER ON statement is executed. Any ON TIMER events
     that occur while trapping is suspended are remembered and processed
     when the next TIMER ON statement is executed. However, remembered
     events are lost if TIMER OFF is executed.
 
   ■ When a timer-event trap occurs (that is, the GOSUB is performed), an
     automatic TIMER STOP is executed so that recursive traps cannot take
     place. The RETURN from a trapping routine automatically performs a
     TIMER ON statement unless an explicit TIMER OFF was performed inside
     the routine.

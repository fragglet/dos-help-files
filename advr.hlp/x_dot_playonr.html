    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

 PLAY {ON | OFF | STOP}
 
 Usage Notes
   ■ If your program contains event-handling statements and you are compiling
     from the BC command line, use the /W or /V option. If you do not use
     these options and your program contains event traps, Visual Basic
     generates the error message, "ON event without /V or /W on command
     line." See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='../unknown.html#.BC.EXE'>BC Command-Line Options</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
   ■ PLAY ON enables play-event trapping. A play event occurs when the
     number of notes in the background-music queue drops below the limit
     you set in the ON PLAY statement. If a play event occurs after a
     PLAY ON statement, the routine specified in the ON PLAY statement is
     executed.
 
   ■ PLAY OFF disables play-event trapping so no trapping takes place
     until another PLAY ON statement is executed. Events occurring while
     trapping is off are ignored.
 
   ■ PLAY STOP suspends play-event trapping so no trapping takes place until
     a PLAY ON statement is executed. Any ON PLAY events that occur while
     trapping is suspended are remembered and processed when the next PLAY
     ON statement is executed. However, remembered events are lost if PLAY
     OFF is executed.
 
   ■ When a play-event trap occurs (that is, the GOSUB is performed), an
     automatic PLAY STOP is executed so that recursive traps cannot take
     place. The RETURN from a trapping routine automatically executes a PLAY
     ON statement unless an explicit PLAY OFF was performed inside the
     routine.

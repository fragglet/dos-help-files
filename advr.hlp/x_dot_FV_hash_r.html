 FV# (rate#, nper#, pmt#, pv#, type%, status%)
 
 Usage Notes
   ■ The argument rate# is the interest rate per period. For example, if you
     get a car loan at a 10% annual interest rate and make monthly payments,
     the rate per period would be .10/12, or .0083.
 
   ■ The argument nper# is the total number of payment periods in an annuity.
     For example, if you get a 4-year car loan and make monthly payments,
     your loan has a total number of 4x12, or 48 payment periods.
 
   ■ The arguments rate# and nper# must use consistent units. For example:
 
         Rate#     Nper#    Loan Description
         ══════    ═════    ════════════════════════════════════════════════
         .10/12    4*12     Monthly payment, 4-year loan, 10% annual interest
         .10       4        Annual payment, 4-year loan, 10% annual interest
 
   ■ The pmt# is the payment made each period, and cannot change over the
     life of the annuity. Typically, pmt# contains principal and interest.
 
   ■ The argument pv# is the present value, or lump sum that a series of
     payments to be paid in the future is worth now. For example, when you
     borrow money to buy a car, the loan amount is the present value to the
     lender of the monthly car payments you will make.
 
   ■ The argument status% can be any variable that returns information about
     the success or failure of the calculation. The value of status% will be
     0 if the calculation was successful, and 1 if it was not.
 
   ■ An annuity is a series of constant cash payments made over a continuous
     period of time. An annuity can be a loan (such as a home mortgage), or
     an investment (such as a monthly savings plan).
 
   ■ For all arguments, cash you pay out, such as deposits to savings, is
     represented by negative numbers; cash you receive, such as dividend
     checks, is represented by positive numbers.

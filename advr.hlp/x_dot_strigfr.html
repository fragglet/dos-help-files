 STRIG(n%)
 
 Usage Notes
   ■ The argument n% is an integer between 0 and 7 that indicates the
     joystick and trigger to check. The following list describes the values
     returned by the STRIG function for different values of n%:
 
                Value
     Argument   Returned   Description
     ════════   ════════   ═════════════════════════════════════════════════
     0          -1         Joystick A's lower trigger was pressed since the
                           last STRIG(0) call
                0          A's lower trigger was not pressed
     1          -1         Joystick A's lower trigger is currently down
                0          A's lower trigger is not down
     2          -1         Joystick B's lower trigger was pressed since the
                           last STRIG(2) call
                0          B's lower trigger was not pressed
     3          -1         Joystick B's lower trigger is currently down
                0          B's lower trigger is not down
     4          -1         Joystick A's upper trigger was pressed since the
                           last STRIG(4) call
                0          A's upper trigger was not pressed
     5          -1         Joystick A's upper trigger is currently down
                0          A's upper trigger is not down
     6          -1         Joystick B's upper trigger was pressed since the
                           last STRIG(6) call
                0          B's upper trigger was not pressed
     7          -1         Joystick B's upper trigger is currently down
                0          B's upper trigger is not down
 
   ■ You cannot use the STRIG function inside a joystick event trap, because
     the trigger information used by STRIG function will not be available for
     ON STRIG. See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='unknown#.onstrigba'>ON STRIG Statement</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
   ■ In previous versions of Microsoft Basic, the statement STRIG ON enabled
     testing of the joystick triggers; STRIG OFF disabled joystick trigger
     testing. The current version of Basic ignores STRIG ON and STRIG OFF
     statements.
 
   ■ The earlier STRIG ON and STRIG OFF should not be confused with the
     current STRIG(n%) ON, STRIG(n%) OFF, and STRIG(n%) STOP statements.
     Note: The STRIG(n%) statements enable, disable, and inhibit trapping of
     joystick events.

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

 Usage Notes
   ■ Use a MouseDown or MouseUp event procedure to prescribe actions to occur
     when a given mouse button is pressed or released.
 
   ■ Unlike the Click and DblClick events, MouseDown and MouseUp events
     allow you to distinguish between the left and right mouse buttons.
 
   ■ You can write code for mouse-keyboard combinations that use the Shift,
     Ctrl, and Alt keyboard modifiers and the MouseMove event.
     See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='../unknown.html#mousemove'>MouseMove Event</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
   ■ The following applies to both Click and DblClick event procedures:
     • If a mouse button is pressed while the pointer is over a form or
       control, that object "captures" the mouse and receives all mouse
       events up to and including the last MouseUp event. This implies that
       the X, Y mouse pointer coordinates given by a mouse event may not
       always be in the client area of the object that receives them;
       however, they will be relative to the object's Top and Left property
       values.
     • If mouse buttons are pressed in succession, the object that captures
       the mouse after the first press receives all mouse events until all
       buttons are released.
 
   ■ Mouse events are detected within border areas of controls that have
     borders. CurrentX and CurrentY values can be used to indicate when the
     mouse is not in the client area of the control.
     See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='../unknown.html#currentx'>CurrentX Property</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>  <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='../unknown.html#currenty'>CurrentY Property</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
   ■ You can use a MouseMove event procedure to respond to an event caused by
     moving the mouse. The Button argument for MouseDown and MouseUp differs
     from the Button argument used for MouseMove. For MouseDown or MouseUp,
     Button indicates exactly one button per event; for MouseMove, it
     indicates the current state of all buttons.

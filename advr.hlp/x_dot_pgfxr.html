 GET [STEP](x1!y1!)-[STEP](x2!,y2!), arrayname[(index%)]
 PUT [STEP](x1!,y1!), arrayname[(index%)] [,actionverb]
 
 Usage Notes
   ■ You must be in a graphics screen mode (for example, screen mode 1) to
     use the GET or PUT statement; otherwise, Visual Basic may generate the
     error message, "Illegal function call." See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='../unknown.html#.SCREENS'>SCREEN Statement</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
   ■ Unless the array type is integer or long, the contents of an array after
     a GET operation appear meaningless when inspected directly. Examining or
     manipulating noninteger arrays that contain graphics images can cause
     run-time errors.
 
   ■ The STEP keyword makes the specified coordinates relative to the most
     recent point. For example, if the last point plotted were (10,10), then
     the actual coordinates referred to by STEP (5,10) would be (5+10,10+10)
     or (15,20). If the second coordinate pair in a GET statement has a STEP
     argument, it is relative to the first coordinate pair.
 
   ■ GET (x1!,y1!)-(x2!,y2!) specifies the screen coordinates of opposite
     corners of the rectangular image to store.
 
   ■ PUT (x1!,y1!) specifies the coordinates for the upper-left corner of
     the rectangle enclosing the image to be placed in the current output
     window. The entire rectangle must be within the bounds of the current
     viewport.
 
   ■ The argument arrayname can be of any numeric type; its dimensions must
     be large enough to hold the entire image.
 
   ■ The GET statement transfers a screen image into the array specified by
     arrayname. The PUT statement, associated with GET, transfers the image
     stored in the array onto the screen.
 
   ■ The following formula gives the required size of the array in bytes:
 
         4+INT(((x2-x1+1)*(bits-per-pixel-per-plane)+7)/8)*planes*((y2-y1)+1)
 
   ■ The bits-per-pixel-per-plane and planes values depend on the screen
     mode set by the SCREEN statement. The following table shows the number
     of bits-per-pixel-per-plane ("Bits" below) and the number of planes
     ("Planes" below) for each screen mode:
 
         Screen Mode                    Bits     Planes
         ══════════════════════════     ════     ═══════════════════════════
         1                              2        1
         2                              1        1
         7                              1        4
         8                              1        4
         9 (&gt; 64K EGA memory)           1        4
         9 (64K EGA memory)             1        2
         10                             1        2
         11                             1        1
         13                             8        1
 
   ■ The bytes per element of an array are:
 
         Bytes per Element     Array Type
         ═════════════════     ═════════════════════════════════════════════
         2                     Integer
         4                     Long-integer
         4                     Single-precision
         8                     Double-precision
         8                     Currency
 
   ■ For example, suppose you want to use the GET statement to store an image
     in high resolution (SCREEN 2). If the coordinates of the upper-left
     corner of the image are (0,0), and the coordinates of the lower-right
     corner are (32,32), then the required size of the array is:
 
         4 + INT((33 * 1 + 7)/8) * 1 * (33)  ' or 169 bytes
 
     This means that an integer array with 85 elements would be large enough
     to hold the image.
 
   ■ GET and PUT statements operating on the same image should be executed in
     matching screen modes. This can be either the same screen mode or any
     screen modes with the same values for planes and bits-per-pixel-per-
     plane.
 
   ■ GET and PUT arguments can be used to display a stored image with special
     effects such as animation.
 
   ■ The argument actionverb determines the interaction between the stored
     image and the one already displayed on screen:
 
     Keyword       Description
     ═══════       ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     XOR           (Default) Inverts the points on the screen where a point
                   exists in the array image:
                   • When an image is placed on the screen against a complex
                     background twice, the background is restored; this
                     behavior is exactly like that of the cursor.
                   • You can move an object around the screen without erasing
                     the background, thus creating animation effects.
     PSET          Transfers the data point-by-point onto the screen. Each
                   point has the exact color attribute it had when it was
                   taken from the screen with GET.
     PRESET        The same as PSET, except that a negative image is produced
                   - for example, black on white.
     AND           Transfers the image only if an image already exists under
                   the transferred image:
                   • The resulting image is the result of a logical AND
                     operation on the stored image and the screen.
                   • Points that have the same color in both the existing
                     image and the stored image remain the same color.
                   • Points that do not have the same color in both the
                     existing image and the stored image do not remain the
                     same color.
     OR            Superimposes the image onto an existing image:
                   • The resulting image is the product of a logical OR
                     operation of the stored image and the screen image.
                   • The stored image does not erase the previous screen
                     contents.

 PV# (rate#, nper#, pmt#, fv#, type%, status%)
 
 Usage Notes
   ■ The argument rate# is the interest rate per period. For example, if you
     get a car loan at a 10% annual interest rate and make monthly payments,
     the rate per period would be .10/12, or .0083.
 
   ■ The argument nper# is the total number of payment periods in an annuity.
     For example, if you get a 4-year car loan and make monthly payments,
     your loan has a total number of 4x12, or 48 payment periods.
 
   ■ The arguments rate# and nper# must use consistent units. For example:
 
         Rate#     Nper#    Loan Description
         ══════    ═════    ════════════════════════════════════════════════
         .10/12    4*12     Monthly payment, 4-year loan, 10% annual interest
         .10       4        Annual payment, 4-year loan, 10% annual interest
 
   ■ The pmt# is the payment made each period, and cannot change over the
     life of the annuity. Typically, pmt# contains principal and interest.
 
   ■ The argument fv# is the future value, or cash balance sometime in the
     future after the final payment is made. The future value of a loan, for
     example, is 0. As another example, if you think you will need $50,000 in
     18 years to pay for your child's education, then $50,000 is the future
     value.
 
   ■ The argument status% can be any variable that returns information about
     the success or failure of the calculation. The value of status% will be
     0 if the calculation was successful, and 1 if it was not.
 
   ■ For all arguments, cash you pay out, such as deposits to savings, is
     represented by negative numbers; cash you receive, such as dividend
     checks, is represented by positive numbers.

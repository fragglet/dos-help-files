<pre>WORD COULD NOT SEARCH ALL REQUESTED FILES.
THE LIST MAY BE INCOMPLETE.
 
This message may arise for a number of reasons:
■ The files you requested are in use by another
  user or program on the network.
■ The files you requested may also be in use in
  another Word session or in another application,
  such as OS/2 or Windows.
■ A directory containing a large number of files
  was searched.
■ If the original search was not completed, this
  message will reappear in File Management
  sessions until a complete search is done.

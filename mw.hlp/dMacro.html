<pre>Macro
 
A sequence of keystrokes, commands, and
instructions that is named and stored. A macro
may then be "run" (Macro Run command),
performing the recorded sequence of actions
automatically. For example, you could use the
Macro Record command to create a macro that would
automatically save a file in text-only format,
save the file to a particular directory, and then
print the file. Macros can also be written (as
opposed to recorded) and may include a range of
programming instructions and variables.

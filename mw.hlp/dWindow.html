    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>Window
 
A rectangular portion of the screen in which you
view and/or edit a document, style sheet, or
online Help. In Word, you can open nine windows
at once plus the Help window. Each window can
contain a different document or style sheet, or
you can open the same document in another window
to see different parts of the document or to look
at it in different views, such as outline view or
layout view. Having multiple windows open is
handy for cutting and pasting from one document
to another.

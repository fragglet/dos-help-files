<pre>TOO MANY BITMAPS ARE LINKED TO THIS FILE.
 
When a graphic is inserted from the Windows
Clipboard, a filename is automatically assigned.
When Word has created 100 unique extensions, you
cannot insert any additional Windows Clipboard
files until you rename the bitmaps Word has
created in the current directory.
 
1. Rename the bitmaps that Word has created in the
   current directory.
2. Rename the filename in the graphics string to
   correspond to the bitmaps that were renamed on
   the disk.
3. Then insert the additional Windows Clipboard
   files.

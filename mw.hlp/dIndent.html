<pre>Indent
 
The distance between the beginning or end of a
line and the left or right page margin. Indents
usually make text narrower than the space
between margins. Three indents are associated
with each paragraph: left, right, and first line.
The first line of each paragraph can be indented
by giving it a positive indent measurement, or
a hanging indent can be created by giving the
first line a negative indent measurement. Use the
Format Paragraph command to specify indentation.
See also: Hanging indent.

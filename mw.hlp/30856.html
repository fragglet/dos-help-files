<pre>THE RESULT EXCEEDS 14 DIGITS.
 
Word cannot perform an operation that results in
more than 14 digits.
 
â–  Review the numbers in your selection to make
  sure that a misplaced decimal has not created
  a very large number. If the numbers in the
  selection are correct, you will not be able to
  use Word to perform the calculation as it is
  expressed.

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>THE RESULT EXCEEDS 14 DIGITS.
 
Word cannot perform an operation that results in
more than 14 digits.
 
â–  Review the numbers in your selection to make
  sure that a misplaced decimal has not created
  a very large number. If the numbers in the
  selection are correct, you will not be able to
  use Word to perform the calculation as it is
  expressed.

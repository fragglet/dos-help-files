    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>THERE WAS A PROBLEM WRITING TO DISK OR TO A
DEVICE.
 
There are several possible reasons for this
message. Before you continue:
 
■ If you are trying to print a file, reset the
  printer, check the connections, and try again.
■ If you suspect the disk is damaged, save the
  file again on a different disk. If you were
  saving the file to a hard disk, try saving it
  to a floppy disk. If you are successful, this
  may indicate that your hard disk is damaged.
■ If the disk has a write-protect tab, remove it
  and try saving again.

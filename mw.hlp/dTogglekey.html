<pre>Toggle key
 
A type of key, such as Scroll Lock (SL), Num Lock
(NL), Caps Lock (CS), Insert (OT/overtype), and
F8 (EX/extend), that you turn on by pressing once
and turn off by pressing again. Sometimes
referred to as a locking key. When a toggle key is
turned on, its two-letter abbreviation appears in
the status bar at the bottom of the Word screen.
 
You can also toggle other Word functions, such as
speed formatting keys. For example, bold
formatting can be toggled on and off by selecting
text and pressing Ctrl+B. See also: Speed
formatting key; Status bar.

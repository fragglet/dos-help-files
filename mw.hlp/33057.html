Options
 Always Suggest: If turned on, Word suggests
   alternate spellings each time a misspelled word
   is found. Otherwise, suggestions are only made
   if Suggest is chosen in the Spelling dialog
   box. Spell checking is faster if this option is
   turned off.
 
 Check Punctuation: Checks for text with misplaced
   punctuation characters. Spell checking is
   faster with this option turned off.
 
 Ignore All Caps: Ignores words with all capital
   letters when spell checking.

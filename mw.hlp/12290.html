<pre>THERE IS NOT ENOUGH MEMORY TO PERFORM THIS
ACTION.
 
If your document is extremely long or you made
many changes since you last saved:
 
■ Choose File Close All and then reopen the
  document you want to work on.
 
If you attempted to run a program using File DOS
Commands or File OS/2 Commands and it was too
large for remaining memory:
 
■ Close all documents and try again. If there
  still is not enough memory, exit Word to run
  the program.

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>THERE IS NOT ENOUGH MEMORY TO PERFORM THIS
ACTION.
 
If your document is extremely long or you made
many changes since you last saved:
 
■ Choose File Close All and then reopen the
  document you want to work on.
 
If you attempted to run a program using File DOS
Commands or File OS/2 Commands and it was too
large for remaining memory:
 
■ Close all documents and try again. If there
  still is not enough memory, exit Word to run
  the program.

Error 30:  "[" expected
 
QuickPascal encountered a set constructor or an array
and expects an index or range (delimited by square
brackets). Or, an array or type declaration is missing a
range.
 
If the brackets are unbalanced, add the opening bracket
to balance them. If you don't currently specify an index
number or set member and you want to refer to an array or
set, add the index number or set member between square
brackets.

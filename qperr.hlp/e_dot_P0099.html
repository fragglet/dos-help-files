Error 99:  INTERFACE expected
 
QuickPascal expects an INTERFACE statement immediately
following the unit declaration. Any variables, constants,
procedures, etc., that you want a calling program to have
access to must appear within the INTERFACE portion of the
unit. Place any declarations that you do not want the
calling program to access in the IMPLEMENTATION section of
the unit.

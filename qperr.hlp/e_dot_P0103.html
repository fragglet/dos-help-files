Error 103:  Invalid QPU file
 
The USES statement refers to a file that is not a valid
.QPU file. Either the file does not exist, or it exists
but is not a compiled QuickPascal unit.
 
Check to make sure the file exists and is spelled
correctly. If the problem persists, delete the .QPU file
and recompile the unit from its original source code.

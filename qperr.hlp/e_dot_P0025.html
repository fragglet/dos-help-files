Error 25:  Identifier or label already defined
 
This name is already defined as having a different value
or meaning.
 
Identifiers within the same scope must be unique. One
name can refer only to one data type, one procedure, one
function, etc. A label can be defined only once. A label
may not be defined twice in the same program.
 
Give this identifier a new name, or rename the previous
one that uses this same name. Change the current label or
the previous label with the same name or number.

Error 1:  Out of memory
 
There was not enough memory for compiling. Either the
program was too big or available memory was insufficient.
 
■ Split a large program into smaller parts. Put functions
  and procedures into a unit. Allocate variables
  dynamically rather than statically.
 
■ Close unneeded windows before compiling.
 
■ Reinvoke QP, swapping to disk or to expanded memory.
    To swap to disk:               QP /SWAP:DISK
    To swap to expanded memory:    QP /SWAP:EMS

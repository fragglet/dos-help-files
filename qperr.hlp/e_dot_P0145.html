Error 145:  Too many opened files
 
Compilation has exceeded the number of available DOS file
handles.
 
File handles are taken up by used units and by files
included with the {$I} directive. Reduce the number of
files in a single compilation, or increase the number of
available handles by putting the following in CONFIG.SYS:
 
   FILES=20
 
TSR (terminate-and-stay-resident) programs may use up file
handles. Remove resident software, then recompile.

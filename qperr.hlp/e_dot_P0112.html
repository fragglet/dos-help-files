Error 112:  Header does not match previous declaration
 
This procedure or function header does not match its
original declaration.
 
A procedure or function's first declaration takes
precedence over a subsequent header. The headers must
match exactly. Change the incorrect header to match the
correct one. Cutting and pasting ensures a perfect match.

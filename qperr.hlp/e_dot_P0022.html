Error 22:  END expected
 
QuickPascal found the end of a statement block without the
END keyword.
 
If an END keyword is present, check for balanced BEGIN
and END statements. Also check for END statements in
constructs that expect END statements but do not use
BEGIN statements (such as CASE statements).

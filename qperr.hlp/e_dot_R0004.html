Run-Time Error 4:  Out of file handles
 
The program ran out of DOS file handles when it tried to
open a file. This probably occurred during a call to the
Append, Reset, or Rewrite procedures.
 
Increase the setting in CONFIG.SYS to FILES=20, or reduce
the number of files open at any one time. QuickPascal may
use some file handles; try to run the program outside the
QuickPascal environment.
 
TSR (terminate-and-stay-resident) programs may use up file
handles. Remove resident software, then run the program.

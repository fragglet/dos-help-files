Error 100:  IMPLEMENTATION expected
 
Place an IMPLEMENTATION statement prior to any executable
code. If there are declarations that you do not want the
calling program to have access to, place them in the
IMPLEMENTATION section of a unit. Such declarations
typically include variables, constants, etc., that need to
be available to all of the unit's procedure and function
definitions.

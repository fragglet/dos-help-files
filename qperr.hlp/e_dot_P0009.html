Error 9:  Illegal character
 
QuickPascal encountered an invalid character.
 
Some illegal characters do not appear on the screen.
QuickPascal placed the cursor where it found the invalid
character. Use the DEL key to remove that character (and
retype it if necessary). If the problem persists, retype
the entire line.
 
Valid QuickPascal source code characters are a..z, A..Z,
0..9, $ @ _ ; : , . + - * / = ^ ' # &lt; &gt; [ ] ( ) { } and
" " (blank space). Other characters are valid only in
comments.

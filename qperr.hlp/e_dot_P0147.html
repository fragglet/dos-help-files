Error 147:  Directive must be at top of program
 
A global compiler directive was located after the
beginning of declaration of a program or unit.
 
Global compiler directives must precede the implementation
section in a unit. In a program, they must precede the
first declaration, appearing before any CONST, TYPE, VAR,
PROCEDURE, or FUNCTION. Global compiler directives are
usually located immediately after any USES statements.

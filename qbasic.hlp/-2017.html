Cannot continue is a prompt that may occur while you are
debugging. While your program was suspended (at a
breakpoint, for example) you made a change to the program
that has implications throughout the program. You may have
changed the dimensions of an array, changed procedure
arguments, or edited some other declarative statement. Use
the dialog box and either:
   ■ Choose &lt;OK&gt; to keep the change and restart the program.
   ■ Choose &lt;Cancel&gt; to undo the change in your program
     text. (You can do this if restarting interferes with
     your debugging strategy.)

 QBasic is an easy-to-use environment for creating Basic programs.
 The following table lists some solutions if you need to go beyond QBasic.
 
 If you need                     You can
 ═══════════════════════════     ═════════════════════════════════════════════
 
 Fast program execution          Use a Basic compiler (such as Microsoft
                                 Visual Basic for MS-DOS) to translate your
                                 Basic code into native machine code.
 
 To build programs that          Use a Basic development environment that
 require over 160K of memory     supports creating large programs.
 
 To distribute your programs     Use Microsoft Visual Basic for MS-DOS or
                                 another Basic compiler to create stand-alone
                                 applications from your QBasic code. This
                                 allows you to distribute your programs and
                                 eliminates the need for QBasic to be present.
 
 To add mouse control to your    Use Microsoft Visual Basic for MS-DOS, which
 application or create a         has built-in mouse support and tools to help
 standard user interface.        you create an attractive user interface.

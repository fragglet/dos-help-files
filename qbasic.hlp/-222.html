    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>During debugging, you used the Set Next Statement command to
specify a statement that is in a procedure other than
the one where program execution is suspended. In this case,
QBasic ignores the Set Next Statement command.
 
To continue debugging, move the suspended procedure into the
View window. You can then use the Set Next Statement command
to start running from any statement in that procedure.

<div class="page-title"> FOR index variable already in use</div>
<pre>This error occurs when the same variable is used as the
counter argument in one FOR...NEXT statement and in a
nested FOR...NEXT statement inside that loop.  Nested
FOR...NEXT statements must use diffrent variables for
their counter arguments.

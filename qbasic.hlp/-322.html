    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>Use Continue (or press F5) to resume running a program
after it has stopped. Continue does not clear data you
entered while the program was running and begins the
program from the last statement executed, rather than
from the beginning.
 
Continue is often used to resume program execution after
a breakpoint.

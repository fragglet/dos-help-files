<pre>Certain internal limitations of QBasic have been exceeded.
 
For example, during expression evaluation, strings that are
not associated with variables are assigned temporary
locations. A large number of such strings can cause this
error to occur. Likewise, a numeric expression made up of
many complicated subexpressions can cause this error.
 
Try simplifying expressions or assigning strings to
variables.

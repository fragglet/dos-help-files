    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<div class="page-title"> Path/file access error</div>
<pre>During an OPEN, MKDIR, CHDIR, or RMDIR operation, the
operating system was unable to make a correct connection
between the path and filename.
 
In the QBasic environment, make sure the file specification
you entered in the text box is formatted correctly. Any
filename can contain a drive name and a full or partial
path.
 
This error can also occur when you try to save a file which
would replace an existing read-only file.
 
ERR code: 75

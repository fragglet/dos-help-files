    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<div class="page-title"> Toggle Breakpoint Command</div>
<pre>Use Toggle Breakpoint (or press F9) to turn breakpoints
on and off. Breakpoints are markers placed on statements
in your program. If you run your program and it encounters
a breakpoint, the program stops on that statement. QBasic
highlights the breakpoint line.
 
To turn a breakpoint on and off:
  1. Move the cursor to the line you want the breakpoint
     on, or to a highlighted breakpoint line.
  2. Choose Toggle Breakpoint (or press F9).
 
Use a breakpoint to pause your program at a point where
you suspect problems, then:
  ■ Print the values of variables in the Immediate window.
  ■ Single step your program from the breakpoint forward.

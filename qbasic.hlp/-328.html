Use Procedure Step (or press F10) to run a single statement
in your program and to run a procedure call and the
procedure it calls as a single statement.
 
Procedure Step, like the Step command, allows you to move
through the execution of a program one step at a time, but
it saves you from stepping through procedures that you
know work correctly.

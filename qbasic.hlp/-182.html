<div class="page-title"> Breakpoint not allowed on CASE clause</div>
<pre>There are some restrictions on using breakpoints to debug
SELECT...END SELECT statements. You cannot place a
breakpoint on the first statement in the CASE block or
after the END SELECT statement.
 
To debug a SELECT...END SELECT statement with the aid of a
breakpoint, set the breakpoint on the SELECT CASE line in
your program. Then single-step through the rest of the
statement structure.

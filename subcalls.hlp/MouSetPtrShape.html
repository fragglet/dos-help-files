    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

#define INCL_MOU
 
USHORT MouSetPtrShape(pbBuffer, pmoupsInfo, hmou)
PBYTE pbBuffer;          /* address of buffer with shape masks     */
PPTRSHAPE pmoupsInfo;    /* address of structure with shape info. */
HMOU hmou;               /* mouse handle                           */
 
The MouSetPtrShape function sets the AND and XOR masks that define the shape
of the mouse pointer for the specified mouse. MouSetPtrShape also sets
information about the pointer, such as the width and height of masks and the
location of the hot spot.
 
<b>Parameter   Description</b>
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
<i>pbBuffer</i>    Points to the buffer that contains the new masks.
 
<i>pmoupsInfo  Points to the PTRS</i>HAPE structure that contains the new pointer
            information.
 
<i>hmou</i>        Identifies the mouse. The handle must have been created
            previously by using the MouOpen function.
 
<b>Return Value</b>
 
The return value is zero if the function is successful. Otherwise, it is an
error value, which may be one of the following:
 
     ERROR_MOUSE_INV_PARMS
     ERROR_MOUSE_NO_DEVICE
 
<b>Comments</b>
 
The MouSetPtrShape function copies the AND and XOR masks from the buffer
pointed to by the pbBuffer parameter. The format and size of the masks
depend on the display device and the video mode. In text mode, each mask is
typically a character/attribute pair. In graphics mode, each mask is a
bitmap.
 
The MouSetPtrShape function copies information about the pointer from the
structure pointed to by the pmoupsInfo parameter. The structure defines the
length (in bytes) of the AND and XOR masks, the width and height of each
mask, and the offset from the current mouse position (or hot spot) to the
upper-left corner of the pointer.
 
If the pointer is displayed, the MouSetPtrShape function may not display a
new shape immediately. If the pointer is not displayed, you must use the
<b>MouRemovePtr and MouDrawPtr function</b>s to display the new shape.
 
The pointer shape is dependent on the device driver used to support the
display device. In text mode, MS OS/2 supports the pointer shape as a
reverse block character. This character has a one-character height and
width; that is, in text modes, the height and width fields must each be one.
You can determine the current pointer shape in effect for the screen group
by using the MouGetPtrShape function.

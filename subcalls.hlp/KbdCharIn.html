    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

PKBDKEYINFO pkbci;    /* pointer to structure for keystroke info. */
USHORT fWait;         /* wait/no-wait flag                        */

The KbdCharIn function retrieves character and scan-code information from a
logical keyboard. The function copies the information to a specified
structure. Keystroke information includes the character value of a given
key, the scan code, the keystroke status, the state of the shift keys, and
the system time (in milliseconds) when the keystroke occurred.
 
The KbdCharIn function is a family API function.
 
<b>Parameter  Description</b>
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
<i>pkbci      Poin</i>ts to the KBDKEYINFO structure that receives the keystroke
           information.
 
<i>fWait</i>      Specifies whether to wait for keystroke information if none is
           available. If this parameter is IO_WAIT, the function waits for a
           keystroke if one is not available. If this parameter is
           IO_NOWAIT, the function returns immediately whether or not it
           retrieved any keystroke information. The fbStatus field in the
           KBDKEYINFO structure specifies whether a keystroke is received.
           The fbStatus field is nonzero if a keystroke is received or zero
           if not.
 
<i>hkbd</i>       Identifies the logical keyboard. The handle must have been
           created by using the KbdOpen function.
 
<b>Return Value</b>
 
The return value is zero if the function is successful. Otherwise, it is an
error value, which may be one of the following:
 
     ERROR_KBD_FOCUS_REQUIRED
     ERROR_KBD_INVALID_IOWAIT
     ERROR_KBD_INVALID_HANDLE
 
<b>Comments</b>
 
The KbdCharIn function copies and removes keystroke information from the
input buffer of the specified logical keyboard. Although echo mode for the
logical keyboard may be turned on, KbdCharIn does not echo the characters it
reads. If the keyboard is in ASCII mode, KbdCharIn retrieves keystroke
information for each key pressed except shift keys. If the keyboard is in
binary mode, KbdCharIn retrieves keystroke information for any key pressed
except shift keys. In most cases, a shift key is pressed in combination with
other keys to create a single keystroke. In binary mode with shift reporting
turned on, a shift key by itself creates a keystroke this function can
retrieve. For more information on binary mode and shift-reporting mode, see
the KbdSetStatus function.
 
The KbdCharIn function retrieves extended ASCII codes, such as when the ALT
key and another key, called the primary key, are pressed simultaneously.
When the function retrieves an extended code, it sets the chChar field of
the KBDKEYINFO structure to 0x0000 or 0x00E0. It also sets the fbStatus
field to EXTENDED_CODE and copies the extended code to the chScan field.
Note that both fields need to be examined to determine whether an extended
code has been received. The extended code is usually the scan code of the
primary key. In ASCII mode, the function retrieves only complete extended
codes, which means that if both bytes of the extended code do not fit in the
buffer, neither byte is retrieved.
 
This function must be called twice to retrieve a code for a double-byte
character set (DBCS). If the code retrieved is the first byte of a
double-byte character, the fbStatus field of the KBDKEYINFO structure is set
to 0x0080.
 
<b>Restrictions</b>
 
In real mode, the following restrictions apply to the KbdCharIn function:
 
♦  It does not copy the system time to the KBDKEYINFO structure and there is
   no interim character support.
 
♦  It retrieves characters only from the default logical keyboard (handle
   0).
 
♦  The fbStatus field can be 0x0000 or SHIFT_KEY_IN.
 
♦  The hkbd parameter is ignored.
 
<b>Example</b>
 
This example calls the KbdCharIn function to retrieve a character, and then
displays the character on the screen.
 
KBDKEYINFO kbci;
KbdCharIn(&amp;kbci,                  /* structure for data */
    IO_WAIT,                      /* waits for key      */
    0);                           /* keyboard handle    */
VioWrtTTY(&amp;kbci.chChar, 1, 0);

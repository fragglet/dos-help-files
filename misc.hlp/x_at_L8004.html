     BSCMAKE builds a database (.BSC file) in the most efficient way
     it can. You need to understand the database-building process to
     avoid some potential problems.
 
     How BSCMAKE Builds a Database
 
     During a build, BSCMAKE first attempts to update the database
     incrementally by using only those .SBR files that have changed.
     It looks for a .BSC (database) file, either as specified with the
     /o option or with the base name of the first .SBR file specified
     and with a .BSC extension. If the file exists, BSCMAKE performs
     an incremental build. If the file does not exist, BSCMAKE
     performs a full build.
 
     When building a database, BSCMAKE truncates the .SBR files to
     zero length. This saves disk space and tells BSCMAKE that the
     file has no new contribution for the database, so no update of
     that part of the database is required during a subsequent build.
 
     The /n option forces a full build even if a database already
     exists. It also prevents the .SBR files from being truncated.

     Requirements for Building a Database
 
     For a full build to succeed, all specified .SBR files must exist
     and must not be truncated. If any .SBR file is truncated, you must
     first rebuild it before running BSCMAKE.
 
     For an incremental build to succeed, the .BSC file specified by /o
     (or having the base name of the first .SBR file) must exist. All
     contributing .SBR files must exist and must be specified. If an
     .SBR file is omitted from the command line, BSCMAKE removes it
     from the database.

─────RM, UNDEL, EXP─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
     The RM, UNDEL, and EXP utilities help you create backup files and
     manage those files.
 
     <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='rm.html'>RM Utility</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
          Removes a file into a hidden subdirectory named DELETED.
 
     <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='undel.html'>UNDEL Utility</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
          Moves an undeleted file into DELETED's parent directory.
 
     <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='exp.html'>EXP Utility</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
          Expunges the DELETED directory and all of its files.
 
     You can use RM, UNDEL, and EXP to manage the backup files created
     by the Microsoft Programmer's WorkBench (PWB). PWB stores backup
     files in DELETED when its Backup switch is set to undel.
 
     NOTE:  Be sure to use matching versions of RM, EXP, and UNDEL. To
            check version numbers, run each utility with the /? option.
 
     Examples
 
          RM /R \PROJECT
 
     This command line tells RM to delete all files in the directory
     tree whose root is the directory named PROJECT. The PROJECT
     directory lies in the root directory on the current drive. RM
     moves all files in this tree to hidden directories named DELETED,
     each of which is created as a subdirectory of a directory that
     contains the file to be deleted.
 
          UNDEL \PROJECT\WORK\REPORT.TXT
 
     This command line tells UNDEL to restore the file called
     REPORT.TXT in the directory \PROJECT\WORK on the current drive. If
     a file called REPORT.TXT already exists in \PROJECT\WORK, UNDEL
     changes it into a backup file in \PROJECT\WORK\DELETED before
     it restores REPORT.TXT. If UNDEL finds more than one file called
     REPORT.TXT in \PROJECT\WORK\DELETED, it prompts for which version
     to restore.
 
          EXP /R \PROJECT\WORK
 
     This command line tells EXP to:
 
        ■ Delete the hidden directory \PROJECT\WORK\DELETED, along
          with any files in the directory.
 
        ■ Recurse through the tree whose root is \PROJECT\WORK and
          delete any DELETED directories and associated files.

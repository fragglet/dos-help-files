     The WX/WXServer Utility runs a Windows program from a DOS prompt
     within Windows. WX is a command-line utility that runs a Windows
     application from a DOS prompt either in a full screen or in a
     window. WXServer is a Windows program that must be running before
     you can use WX. PWB uses WX to run Windows programs and CVW.
 
     WXServer and WX require Windows 386 enhanced mode. The [386Enh]
     section of SYSTEM.INI must contain the following line:
 
          device=[path\]vmb.386
 
     To run WXServer, double-click its icon in the Microsoft C/C++ 7.0
     group. When WXServer is running, the WXServer icon appears on the
     desktop. It does not come up in a window or full screen.
 
     To run WX, open a DOS session and enter the following command at
     the DOS prompt:
 
          WX [options] program [arguments ...]
 
     The &lt;program&gt; is the filename of the Windows application. The
     &lt;arguments&gt; are any command-line options, filenames, or other
     arguments required to run the program. Specify &lt;options&gt; to WX
     before the program name. Options names are not case sensitive and
     can be abbreviated to the shortest unique name.
 
     Option     Description
 
     /A         Runs the program asynchronously. By default, WX runs
                synchronously, which pauses the DOS session until the
                program ends. /A lets other programs run in the same
                DOS session while the Windows program is running.
 
                When running synchronously, WX requires that the DOS
                prompt run in the background. (Choose the Settings
                command from the Control menu for the DOS prompt, and
                turn on the Background option under Tasking Options.)
 
                WXServer can run only one program synchronously, but it
                can run additional programs asynchronously.
 
     /H[ELP]    Calls the QuickHelp utility. If WX cannot find the Help
                file or QuickHelp, it displays a brief summary of WX
                command-line syntax.
 
     /N[OLOGO]  Suppresses the WX copyright message.
 
     /W         Runs a program from a DOS prompt that is in a window
                rather than full screen.
 
     /?         Displays a brief summary of WX command-line syntax.

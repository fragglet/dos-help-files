     EXP removes the hidden DELETED subdirectory of the current or
     specified directory and all files contained within. Files are
     placed in DELETED by RM. Files are also placed in DELETED by PWB
     when the Backup switch is set to undel. Use EXP along with RM and
     UNDEL to manage backup files. After the files are expunged by EXP,
     they cannot be restored by UNDEL.
 
     Command-Line Syntax
 
     EXP [options] [directories]
 
     EXP has the following options; the option names are not case
     sensitive:
 
     /HELP     Calls the QuickHelp utility. If EXP cannot find the
               Help file or QuickHelp, it displays a brief summary of
               EXP command-line syntax.
 
     /Q        Suppresses display of the names of deleted files.
 
               Recurses into subdirectories of the current or specified
               directory and expunges all DELETED directories and
               hidden files.
 
     /?        Displays a brief summary of EXP command-line syntax.
 
     The &lt;directories&gt; field specifies one or more directories that
     contain DELETED directories to be expunged. If no directory is
     specified, EXP deletes the current directory's DELETED
     subdirectory.

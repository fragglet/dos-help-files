─────UNDEL──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
     UNDEL restores deleted files by moving them from a hidden DELETED
     subdirectory to the parent directory. Files are placed in DELETED
     by RM. Files are also placed in DELETED by PWB when the Backup
     switch is set to undel. Use UNDEL along with RM and EXP to manage
     backup files.
 
     Command-Line Syntax
 
     UNDEL [{option | files}]
 
     UNDEL has the following options; the option names are not case
     sensitive:
 
     /HELP     Calls the QuickHelp utility. If UNDEL cannot find the
               Help file or QuickHelp, it displays a brief summary of
               UNDEL command-line syntax.
 
     /?        Displays a brief summary of UNDEL command-line syntax.
 
     The &lt;files&gt; field specifies one or more files to be restored. You
     can specify a path with the filename. Separate multiple files with
     spaces. You cannot use wildcards (* and ?).
 
     If more than one file in DELETED has the specified name, UNDEL
     lists the versions and prompts for which file to restore. If a
     file with the same name already exists in the parent directory,
     UNDEL moves it to the DELETED directory before it restores the
     specified file.
 
     To list all files in the current directory's DELETED subdirectory,
     specify the UNDEL command alone. However, you cannot list files in
     another directory; UNDEL does not accept a path without a filename.

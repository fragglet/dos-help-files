                                Using Heaps
 
Applications typically create a heap, allocate and deallocate memory blocks
in the heap as needed, and destroy the heap when terminating. A heap can be
created using many different memory sources and it can have movable or
nonmovable memory objects. The following sections discuss how to use heaps
in applications and dynamic-link libraries.
 
<b>Creating a Heap</b>
 
Applications and dynamic-link libraries create a heap by calling the
<b>WinCreateHeap</b> function. The heap is created within an automatic data segment
or in a separate segment, depending on the values of the selHeapBase and
<i>cbHeap parameters </i>of WinCreateHeap. The possible values of these parameters
are summarized in the following list:
 
<b>selHeapBase  cbHeap   Meaning</b>
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
<i>Zero        </i> Zero     The calling process is an application that places the
                      heap at the end of its automatic data segment.
 
<i>Selector     Nonzero  Th</i>e calling process is either a dynamic-link library
                      that places a heap at the end of its automatic data
                      segment, or an application or dynamic-link library
                      that has explicitly allocated a segment and places the
                      heap at the end of the segment.
 
<i>Selector     Zero     Th</i>e calling process is either an application or
                      dynamic-link library that has explicitly allocated a
                      segment and places a heap in that segment.
 
<i>Zero        </i> Nonzero  The calling process is either an application or
                      dynamic-link library that places a heap of a specified
                      size in a separate segment but does not call the
                      DosAllocSeg function.
 
In addition to the characteristics of the heap described by the preceding
list, the creator of the heap may specify whether the heap contains movable
objects and whether the functions should check the validity of certain
arguments to heap-manager functions. The HM_MOVEABLE attribute specifies
that the heap can contain movable objects. The HM_VALIDSIZE attribute, which
can be used only in conjunction with HM_MOVEABLE, specifies that the heap
manager should check the validity of size arguments in heap-deallocation
calls. Movable heap objects allow a more flexible memory-management scheme
for applications with heavy memory requirements.
 
You must specify the minimum amount the heap will grow each time it enlarges
to satisfy a memory request. The default minimum is 512 bytes.
 
The cbMinDed and cbMaxDed parameters of the WinCreateHeap function define
how many dedicated free lists the heap manager should maintain for the heap.
Dedicated free lists can make the allocation of fixed-size blocks
significantly faster, but they are not essential to the operation of the
heap. Zeros can be passed as values for these parameters to generate the
default heap behavior without using dedicated free lists. More information
about dedicated free lists is given later in this section.
 
The following code fragment shows how to create a heap with the default
behavior and the movable attribute:
 
hHeap = WinCreateHeap(0,  /* uses automatic data segment         */
    0,                    /* uses HEAPSIZE from .def file        */
    1024,                 /* minimum size to grow heap           */
    0,                    /* minimum size of dedicated free list */
    0,                    /* maximum size of dedicated free list */
    HM_MOVEABLE);
 
The ability to share a heap depends upon the sharing attributes of the
segment containing the heap. Heaps in an application's data segment are
private to that application. Segments explicitly allocated with the
<b>DosAllocSeg</b> function are shared or private, depending upon the value of the
<i>fsAlloc parameter. Se</i>gments allocated by using the WinCreateHeap function
are shareable. Because shared segments cannot shrink, heaps within a shared
segment also do not shrink.
 
The heap manager does not prevent multiple threads from calling the heap
manager with the same heap handle. The calling process must ensure that this
does not occur.
 
<b>Heaps in a Separate Data Segment</b>
 
One of the options you can specify when creating a heap is that the heap
will be created in a data segment that is separate from the automatic data
segment. You might choose this option if there is insufficient space in the
automatic data segment for the static variables, the stack, and the heap. A
heap in a separate data segment can occupy up to 64K.
 
The pointer returned by the WinAllocMem function is an offset value that
locates the allocated memory block relative to the beginning of the segment
that contains the heap. If the heap is in a separate segment, you must use
far pointers to access memory blocks that are allocated on the heap. You can
determine the far pointer to a heap object by using the heap's segment
selector and the offset. The WinLockHeap function returns a far pointer to
the beginning of a specified heap. You can combine the selector from this
far pointer with the offset to a memory block on the heap to produce a far
pointer to the heap object, as shown in the following code fragment:
 
HHEAP   hHeap;
SEL     selHeap;
NPBYTE  npbObject;
PBYTE   pbObject;
PVOID   pvHeap;
 
/* Allocate a heap in a separate segment. */
 
hHeap = WinCreateHeap(0,  /* uses a separate segment             */
    32*1024,              /* allocates 32K for heap              */
    1024,                 /* minimum size to grow heap           */
    0,                    /* minimum size of dedicated free list */
    0,                    /* maximum size of dedicated free list */
    HM_MOVEABLE);
 
/* Allocate an object and retrieve a near pointer. */
 
npbObject = WinAllocMem(hHeap,...);
 
/* Retrieve a far pointer to the start of the heap. */
 
pvHeap = WinLockHeap(hHeap);
 
/* Make a far pointer to the heap object. */
 
pbObject = MAKEP(SELECTOROF(pvHeap), npbObject);
 
<b>Movable Heap Objects</b>
 
A movable heap allows the memory objects within the heap to move in order to
reclaim fragmented heap space. All heaps are movable in the sense that a
segment that contains a heap can move as a result of the mapping of
selectors to physical addresses that is provided by MS OS/2. Movable heaps
differ from regular heaps in that individual objects within a movable heap
can change their positions relative to the beginning of the segment. The
movable-heap attribute is specified when the heap is created and lasts until
the heap is destroyed.
 
Allocated memory blocks in a movable heap have a header structure that is
attached to the beginning of the block. This header structure contains a
pointer to the variable holding the pointer to the memory block and a field
containing the size of the block (not including the header structure). The
near pointer returned by the WinAllocMem function points to the first byte
after the block-header words. The C definition of the header structure is as
follows:
 
typedef struct _MOVBLOCKHDR {
    NPBYTE near *ppmem;
    USHORT      cb;
} MOVBLOCKHDR;
 
The size parameter of the WinReallocMem and WinFreeMem functions is ignored
for objects in a movable heap and the value of the size word is used
instead. However, if the HM_VALIDSIZE option is specified in the
<b>WinCreateHeap function when the heap is</b> created, the WinReallocMem and
<b>WinFreeMem</b> functions verify that the passed size matches the current size
and return an error if it does not.
 
Objects in a movable heap can move whenever the WinAvailMem function is
called. Because this function is also called by WinAllocMem and
<b>WinReallocMem</b>, objects can also move when these functions are called.
<b>WinReallocMem and WinAvailMem move bloc</b>ks that have a back pointer.
Allocated objects whose back pointer is zero are considered fixed and do not
move.
 
When allocating memory blocks within a movable heap, the calling process
specifies that the block is movable by altering the back pointer (ppmem)
field of the header structure so that it points to the variable holding the
pointer returned by the WinAllocMem function. When WinAllocMem creates a
block on a movable heap, it clears the back pointer to zero. As long as the
back pointer remains zero, the heap manager cannot move the block. If the
application alters the value of the back pointer so that it points to a
valid variable address within the same segment (by using an offset from the
beginning of the segment), the heap manager will move the block, when
necessary, to compact the heap. Whenever the heap manager moves the movable
block it also updates the variable pointed to by the back pointer so that
the variable points to the new location of the block. The back pointer
ensures that the application's reference to the movable block is updated
when the block moves.
 
Note that MS OS/2 alters only the variable pointed to by the back pointer
when it moves a movable block. If the application has made copies of this
variable, those copies will be invalid if the memory object moves.
 
The SETMEMBACKPTR macro sets the back pointer of a movable block. (It is
assumed that the MOVBLOCKHDR data structure described above is also
defined.) SETMEMBACKPTR uses the variable that holds the pointer returned by
the WinAllocMem function and sets the back pointer of that block to point to
the variable. The SETMEMPACKPTR macro is shown below. Note that it should
not be used on nonmovable heaps.
 
#define SETMEMBACKPTR(npb) (((PMOVBLOCKHDR) npb) -1) -&gt; ppmem = &amp;npb
 
The back pointer of a movable block should point to the variable that holds
the pointer returned by the WinAllocMem function. Since the back pointer is
a near pointer, the variable pointed to must be in the same data segment as
the heap. If the heap is in the automatic data segment (the default case),
you can use a static or stack-based variable to hold the pointer. If the
heap is in a separate data segment, you must allocate space for the pointer
variable as a nonmovable block on the heap.
 
Using movable blocks allows an application to use memory more efficiently
and to avoid most memory-fragmentation problems. Using movable heap objects,
however, requires that the pointer references to the objects remain valid
even when the objects move. The back pointer allows MS OS/2 to handle
updating an application's pointer variables, but the application must use
the SETMEMBACKPTR macro to set the original link between the movable block
and its pointer variable.
 
<b>Movable Heaps in an Automatic Data Segment</b>
 
The following code fragment shows how to allocate a block and then make it
movable by altering the value of the back pointer. This code works only if
the heap is in the automatic data segment (the default case for most
applications).
 
static NPBYTE  pObject;
 
/* Allocate the block for the object. */
 
pObject = WinAllocMem(hHeap, sizeof(YOUR_OBJECT_TYPE));
 
/* Make the block movable. */
 
SETMEMBACKPTR(pObject);
 
You should avoid placing a pointer to a movable heap object on the
stack──that is, making it a local variable──if the heap object will continue
to exist after the function has ended and the local variable has been
cleared from the stack. This is dangerous because the heap manager could
attempt to update the pointer variable, using the back pointer, and
inadvertently write into the stack frame of another function.
 
<b>Movable Heaps in a Separate Data Segment</b>
 
The variable pointed to by the back pointer must be in the same segment as
the movable block. For most applications, in which the heap is in the
application's automatic data segment, the pointer variable can be in the
application's static-data area. If the heap is in a separate segment, the
variable must also be allocated on the same heap, and it must be in a
nonmovable block.
 
<b>Allocating Memory from Heaps</b>
 
Once an application or dynamic-link library has created a heap, it can
allocate blocks on the heap by calling the WinAllocMem function. The value
returned by this function is a near pointer to the memory block, or NULL if
the function is unsuccessful.
 
All pointers to memory objects within a heap are 16-bit offsets from the
start of the heap's segment. All memory objects in the heap are aligned on a
32-bit-word boundary──this means that the contents of the 2 low-order bits
of a returned pointer are unused. The WinAllocMem function clears these
bits. (The WinReallocMem and WinFreeMem functions require that they be
zero.) The application can use these two bits for any purpose. The HEAP_MASK
constant can be used to clear the bits when passing a parameter for a
memory-block pointer to WinReallocMem or WinFreeMem.
 
If the heap is created with the HM_MOVEABLE attribute, the size argument for
the allocation is retained in the size word of the allocated block's header.
The returned address is the address of the first byte after the header.
 
The heap manager searches the heap for the first free block large enough to
fulfill the allocation request. If the free block that is found is larger
than what is needed to satisfy the request, the extra space is added to the
appropriate dedicated free list. If no free block is found that is large
enough, the heap manager attempts to combine free blocks by calling the
<b>WinAvailMem</b> function. If this call does not generate a large enough free
block, the heap manager attempts to enlarge the heap segment by the combined
values of the size of the request and the minimum-growth parameter specified
in the call to the WinCreateHeap function. If this attempt fails, the
<b>WinAllocMem</b> function returns NULL, indicating that it could not allocate the
memory block.
 
<b>Deallocating Memory from a Heap</b>
 
Memory blocks on the heap can be deallocated by calling the WinFreeMem
function. The calling process must specify the heap handle, the pointer to
the block, and the size of the block. The size argument must be accurate
because the heap manager does not normally validate this argument. Passing
an incorrect size argument to WinFreeMem can damage other blocks on the
heap.
 
The WinFreeMem function returns NULL if it successfully deallocates the
memory block. This method of returning failure allows for updating the
memory pointer and freeing the memory at the same time, which can be
accomplished with a call similar to the following:
 
npMem = WinFreeMem(hHeap, npMem, cbMem);
 
For nonmovable heaps, the heap manager has no way to check the size of
blocks that it deallocates. For movable blocks on a heap created with the
HM_MOVEABLE and HM_VALIDSIZE attributes, the heap manager checks the size
argument against the size specification in the movable block's header and
returns the pointer (instead of NULL) if the size parameter is invalid.
 
<b>Using Dedicated Free Lists</b>
 
A dedicated free list is a linked list of free blocks of a particular size
on the heap. For example, the heap manager might maintain a dedicated free
list of memory blocks that are 1024 bytes in length. It is much faster to
search for a memory block in a dedicated free list than to do a straight
linear search of all blocks on the heap. Thus, dedicated free lists are very
useful if your application allocates many blocks with the same size.
 
The size of memory blocks that should be maintained in dedicated free lists
is specified when the heap is created. Two arguments to the WinCreateHeap
function specify the minimum block size and the maximum block size to put
into dedicated free lists. All memory sizes between the minimum and maximum
sizes, in four-byte increments, are maintained in separate lists.
 
For example, if you specify 1024 for the minimum size and 2048 for the
maximum size, the heap manager creates dedicated free lists for memory
blocks of 1024 bytes, 1028 bytes, 1032 bytes, and so on, through 2048 bytes.
The cost of each dedicated free list is an additional two bytes in the
heap-control block for each size of memory block that is maintained in the
list.
 
Blocks that are not within the size limits of existing dedicated free lists
are maintained in a single nondedicated free list. The heap manager first
looks in the dedicated free lists, starting with the list whose memory-block
size is greater than or equal to the requested size. It continues to look in
the dedicated free lists until it either finds the smallest block that is
greater than or equal to the requested size or it exhausts the dedicated
free lists. If no block is found on the dedicated free lists that is large
enough, the heap manager does a linear search of the nondedicated free list
for the first block that satisfies the request. (This may not be the
smallest free block that would satisfy the request, since the order of the
nondedicated free list is implementation-dependent.) Dedicated free lists
are organized in last-in, first-out (LIFO) order.
 
To produce dedicated free lists in a heap, pass nonzero arguments for the
<i>cbMinDed and cbMaxDed parameters of the </i>WinCreateHeap function.
 
<b>Destroying Heaps</b>
 
The WinDestroyHeap function destroys a heap that was created by using the
<b>WinCreateHeap function. If WinCreateHeap calls the DosAllocSeg fu</b>nction to
allocate space for the heap, then WinDestroyHeap calls DosFreeSeg to free
the allocated segment. Otherwise, WinDestroyHeap frees only the heap handle
that is passed to it.
 
The return value is zero if the WinDestroyHeap function is successful.
Otherwise, the return value is the heap handle that is passed to the
function. (A reason this function could fail is if the heap handle is
invalid.) This function is not affected by allocated memory objects within
the heap.
 
The return value is zero for success because of the following idiom for
destroying a heap and invalidating the variable that contains the handle to
the heap, all in one line of code:
 
hHeap = WinCreateHeap(...);
 
/* Code that manipulates the heap. */
 
hHeap = WinDestroyHeap(hHeap);

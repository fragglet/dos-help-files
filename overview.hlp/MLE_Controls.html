                  About Multiple-Line Entry-Field Controls
 
This section describes how to use multiple-line entry fields to let the user
view and edit text in an application. Before reading this section, you
should be familiar with entry-field controls, messages and message queues,
and standard user-interface guidelines.
 
A multiple-line entry field (MLE) is a sophisticated control window that
users use to view and edit multiple lines of text. An MLE provides all the
text-editing capabilities of a simple text editor, making these features
readily available to applications.
 
You can create multiple-line entry fields by using the WinCreateWindow
function or by specifying the MLE statement in a dialog-window template in a
resource file.
 
<b>MLE Text Editing</b>
 
An MLE contains one or more lines of text. Each line consists of one or more
characters and ends with one or more characters that represent the end of
the line. The user inserts text by typing (when the MLE has the focus). The
application can insert text at any time by using the MLM_INSERT message and
specifying the text as a null-terminated string. The MLE inserts the new
text at the cursor position or replaces the selected text.
 
The entry mode determines the action of the MLE when the user inserts text.
The entry mode can be set to overstrike or insertion. The user sets it by
pressing the INS key. When overstrike mode is enabled, at least one
character is always selected. This means that the MLM_INSERT message always
replaces at least one character. If insert mode is enabled, the MLM_INSERT
message replaces only characters the user or the application has selected.
Otherwise, the MLE makes room for the inserted characters by moving existing
characters to the right at the cursor position.
 
The cursor position, identified by a flashing caret, is always specified as
a character offset, relative to the beginning of text. The user sets the
cursor position by moving the flashing caret by using the mouse or the ARROW
keys. An application can set the cursor position by using the MLM_SETSEL
message. This message directs the MLE to move the flashing caret to a given
character position.
 
The MLM_SETSEL message also sets the selection. The selection is one or more
characters of text on which the MLE carries out an operation, such as
deleting or copying. The user selects text by pressing the SHIFT key while
moving the cursor. An application selects text by specifying the cursor
position and anchor point using the MLM_SETSEL message. The selection is all
text between the cursor position and the anchor point. If the cursor
position and anchor point are equal, there is no selection. An application
can retrieve the cursor position and/or anchor point by using the
<b>MLM_QUERYSEL</b> message.
 
The user can delete characters, one at a time, by pressing the DEL key or
the BKSP key. These keys delete the character to the left of the cursor. An
application can delete one or more characters by using the MLM_DELETE
message. This message directs the MLE to delete a specified number of
characters, starting at the given position. This message does not change the
cursor position. An application can delete selected text by using the
<b>MLM_CLEAR</b> message.
 
An application can reverse the previous operation by using the MLM_UNDO
message. This message directs the MLE to restore the entry field to its
previous state. It is a quick way to fix users' editing mistakes.
 
But not all operations can be undone. The application can determine whether
the previous operation can be undone by using the MLM_QUERYUNDO message.
This message returns TRUE and an indication of the type of operation that
can be undone. An application can prevent a subsequent MLM_UNDO message from
changing the state of the MLE by using the MLM_RESETUNDO message.
 
<b>MLE Text Formatting</b>
 
An application can retrieve the number of lines of text in an MLE by using
the MLM_QUERYLINECOUNT message. It can retrieve the number of characters in
the MLE by using the MLM_QUERYTEXTLENGTH message. The amount of text and,
subsequently, the number of lines to be entered in an MLE depend on the text
limit. An application can set the text limit by using the MLM_SETTEXTLIMIT
message and determine the current limit by using the MLM_QUERYTEXTLIMIT
message. The user cannot set the limit. If the user types to the text limit,
the MLE beeps and ignores subsequent characters. If the application attempts
to add text beyond the limit, the MLE truncates the text.
 
An application can control the length of each line in an MLE by enabling
word-wrapping. When word-wrapping is enabled, the MLE automatically breaks
any line that is longer than the MLE is wide. An application can set
word-wrapping by using the MLM_SETWRAP message, and it can determine whether
the MLE is wrapping text by using the MLM_QUERYWRAP message. Unless the
MLS_WORDWRAP style is specified when the MLE is created, word-wrapping is
initially disabled.
 
An application can set tab stops for an MLE by using the MLM_SETTABSTOP
message. Tab stops specify the maximum width of tab character. When the user
or an application inserts a tab character, the MLE expands the character so
that it fills the space between cursor position and the next tab stop. The
<b>MLM_SETTABSTOP</b> message actually sets the distance (specified in pixels)
between tab stops, and the MLE provides as many tab stops as needed, no
matter how long the line gets. The application can retrieve the distance
between tab stops by using the MLM_QUERYTABSTOP message.
 
An application can use the MLM_SETFORMATRECT message to set the format
rectangle. The format rectangle is used to set the horizontal and/or
vertical limits for text. The MLE sends a notification message to the parent
window of the MLE if text exceeds the limit. An application typically uses
the format rectangle to provide its own word-wrapping or other special text
processing. An application can retrieve the current formatting rectangle by
using the MLM_QUERYFORMATRECT message.
 
An application can prevent the user from entering text in the entry field by
using the MLM_SETREADONLY message. The MLM_QUERYREADONLY message specifies
whether the MLE is read-only. An application can also set the MLE to
read-only by specifying the MLS_READONLY style when creating the MLE.
 
An application can set the colors and font for an MLE by using the
<b>MLM_SETTEXTCOLOR, MLM_SETBACKCOLOR, and MLM_SETFONT messages. These messages</b>
affect all text in the MLE; an MLE cannot contain a mixture of fonts and
colors. An application can retrieve the current values for the color and the
font by using the MLM_QUERYTEXTCOLOR, MLM_QUERYBACKCOLOR, and MLM_QUERYFONT
messages.
 
<b>Importing and Exporting MLE Text</b>
 
An application can copy text to and from an MLE by importing and exporting.
Importing using the MLM_IMPORT message copies text from a buffer to the MLE.
Exporting using the MLM_EXPORT message copies text from the MLE to a buffer.
The application uses the MLM_SETIMPORTEXPORT message to set the import and
export buffers. To import, the application must fill the buffer with the
text to copy to the MLE. To export, the MLE copies the specified text to the
buffer.
 
An application can import and export text in a variety of formats. The text
format identifies which characters are used for the end-of-line characters
and is set by using the MLM_FORMAT message. An MLE can have the following
text formats:
 
<b>Type           Format</b>
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
<i>MLFIE_CFTEXT</i>   Exported lines end with a carriage-return/newline character
               pair (0x0D, 0x0A). Imported lines must end with a newline
               character, a carriage-return/newline character pair, or a
               newline/carriage-return character pair.
 
<i>MLFIE_NOTRANS</i>  Imported and exported lines end with a newline character
               (0x0A).
 
<i>MLFIE_WINFMT</i>   For exported lines, the carriage-return/newline character
               pair marks a hard line break (a break entered by the user),
               and two carriage-return characters and a newline character
               (0x0D, 0x0D, 0x0A) mark a soft line break (a break inserted
               during word-wrapping, not entered by the user). For imported
               lines, soft line break characters are ignored.
 
The text format can affect the number of characters in a selection. To
ensure the export buffer is large enough to hold exported text, an
application can send the MLM_QUERYFORMATLINELENGTH message and the
<b>MLM_QUERYFORMATTEXTLENGTH</b> message to determine the number of bytes in text
to be exported.
 
Each time an application inserts text in an MLE, the MLE automatically
refreshes the display by drawing the new text. When an application copies
large amounts of text to an MLE, refreshing can be quite time-consuming, so
applications should disable the automatic refresh setting in such cases. An
application can disable this setting by sending the MLM_DISABLEREFRESH
message. After copying all the text, the application can restore the refresh
by sending the MLM_ENABLEREFRESH message.
 
<b>MLE Cut, Copy, and Paste Operations</b>
 
The user can cut, copy, and paste text in an MLE by using the CTRL+DEL,
SHIFT+DEL, and SHIFT+INS keys. An application can cut, copy, and paste text
by using the MLM_CUT, MLM_COPY, and MLM_PASTE messages. The MLM_CUT and
<b>MLM_COPY</b> messages direct the MLE to copy the selected text to the clipboard.
The MLM_CUT message also deletes the text (MLM_COPY does not). The
<b>MLM_PASTE</b> message directs the MLE to copy the text on the clipboard to the
current position in the MLE, replacing any existing text with the copied
text. An application can delete the selected text without copying it to the
clipboard by using the MLM_CLEAR message.
 
An application can also copy the selected text from an MLE to a buffer by
using the MLM_QUERYSELTEXT message. This message does not affect the
contents of the clipboard.
 
<b>MLE Search and Replace Operations</b>
 
An application can search for a specified string within MLE text by using
the MLM_SEARCH message. This message directs the MLE to search for the
string. If the string is found, the MLE returns TRUE. The cursor does not
move to the string unless the message specifies the MLFSEARCH_SELECTMATCH
option.
 
An application can also use the MLM_SEARCH message to replace one string
with another. If the MLFSEARCH_CHANGEALL option is specified, the MLE
replaces all occurrences of the search string with the replacement string.
Both the search string and the replacement string must be given in a
<b>MLE_SEARCHDATA</b> structure passed with the message.
 
<b>MLE Notification Codes</b>
 
An MLE sends notification codes to its parent window whenever certain events
occur, for example, when the user or the application tries to insert too
much text or when the user uses the scroll bars. The parent window uses the
notification codes to carry out custom operations for the MLE or to respond
to errors. Notification codes that are closely related to MLE messages are
described here.
 
The MLE sends the MLN_HSCROLL or MLN_VSCROLL notification codes when the
user uses the scroll bars so the application can monitor the visible
contents of the MLE. The application can also monitor the contents of an MLE
by using the MLM_QUERYFIRSTCHAR message. This message identifies the
character in the upper-left corner of the MLE (by specifying its offset).
This represents the first MLE character that is visible to the user. An
application can move a specified character to the upper-left corner of an
MLE by using the MLM_SETFIRSTCHAR message as an alternative way of scrolling
the contents of an MLE.
 
The MLE sends an MLN_CHANGE notification code when the user changes the text
in some way. This code is especially useful when the MLE is in a dialog box,
because it can determine whether the dialog procedure should process the
contents of the MLE. The MLM_QUERYCHANGED message also can determine whether
the user has made changes. The MLM_SETCHANGED message causes the MLE to send
a notification code, regardless of whether the user has changed anything;
this code can also be used to hide a change made by a user.
 
<b>MLE Styles</b>
 
MLE styles can be specified by using the WinCreateWindow function or the
<b>MLE</b> statement in a resource file. Styles can be combined by using the OR
operator. Applications can specify a combination of the following styles for
an MLE:
 
<b>Style          Meaning</b>
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
<i>MLS_BORDER</i>     Draws a border around the MLE.
 
<i>MLS_HSCROLL</i>    Adds a horizontal scroll bar to the MLE. The scroll bar is
               enabled when any line exceeds the width of the MLE.
 
<i>MLS_IGNORETAB</i>  Directs the MLE to ignore the TAB key.
 
<i>MLS_READONLY</i>   Prevents the MLE from accepting text from the user. This
               style is useful for displaying lengthy static text in windows
               or dialog boxes.
 
<i>MLS_VSCROLL</i>    Adds a vertical scroll bar to the MLE. The scroll bar is
               enabled when the number of lines exceeds the height of the
               MLE.
 
<i>MLS_WORDWRAP</i>   Prevents lines that are longer than the width of the MLE. The
               MLE automatically breaks the line at a convenient place.

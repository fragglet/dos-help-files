                    Strategies for Painting and Drawing
 
The following sections discuss drawing strategies for an MS OS/2
application. Because an application shares the screen with other windows and
applications, drawing must not interfere with other applications and
windows. When these strategies are followed, your application will coexist
with other applications and still take full advantage of the graphics
capabilities of MS OS/2.
 
<b>When to Draw in a Window</b>
 
Ideally, all drawing in a window should occur during the processing of a
<b>WM_PAINT</b> message. Applications maintain an internal representation of what
should be displayed in the window, such as text or a linked list of graphics
objects, and use the WM_PAINT message as a cue to display a visual
representation of that data in the window.
 
To route all display output through the WM_PAINT message, an application
should not draw on the screen at the time its data changes. Instead, the
application should update the internal representation of the data and then
call the WinInvalidateRect or WinInvalidateRegion function to invalidate the
portion of the window that needs to be redrawn. Of course, it is often much
more efficient to draw directly in a window without relying on the WM_PAINT
message──for example, when drawing and redrawing an object for a user who is
dragging or sizing with the mouse.
 
If the window has the WS_SYNCPAINT or CS_SYNCPAINT style, invalidating a
portion of the window causes a WM_PAINT message to be sent to the window
immediately. Because sending a message is essentially like making a function
call, the actions corresponding to the WM_PAINT message are carried out
before the call that caused the invalidation returns──that is, the painting
is synchronous.
 
If the window does not have the WS_SYNCPAINT or CS_SYNCPAINT style,
invalidating a portion of the window causes the invalidated region to be
added to the window's update region. The next time the application calls the
<b>WinGetMsg or WinPeekMsg fun</b>ction when there are no other messages in the
queue and the update region for the window is not empty, the application is
sent a WM_PAINT message. If there are many messages in the queue the
painting occurs after the invalidation──that is, the painting is
asynchronous. Painting for windows that do not have the WS_SYNCPAINT or
CS_SYNCPAINT style is a low-priority operation; all other messages are
processed first. Because a WM_PAINT message is not posted to the queue in
this case, all invalidation operations since the last WM_PAINT message are
consolidated into a single WM_PAINT message the next time the application
has no messages in the queue.
 
There are advantages to both synchronous and asynchronous painting. Windows
that have simple painting routines should be painted synchronously. Most of
the system-defined control windows, such as buttons and frame controls, are
painted synchronously because they can be painted quickly without
interfering with the responsiveness of the program. Windows with more
time-consuming painting operations should be painted asynchronously so that
the painting can be initiated only when there are no other pending messages
that might otherwise be blocked while waiting for the window to be painted.
Also, windows that use an incremental approach to invalidating small
portions of the window should usually allow those operations to consolidate
into a single asynchronous WM_PAINT message, rather than a series of
synchronous WM_PAINT messages.
 
If necessary, an application can call the WinUpdateWindow function to cause
an asynchronous window to update itself without going through the event
loop. WinUpdateWindow sends a WM_PAINT message directly to the window if the
window's update region is not empty.
 
<b>The WM_PAINT Message</b>
 
A window receives a WM_PAINT message whenever its update region is not NULL.
A window procedure should respond to a WM_PAINT message by calling the
<b>WinBeginPaint</b> function, drawing to fill in the update areas, and then
calling the WinEndPaint function.
 
The WinBeginPaint function returns a handle to a presentation space that is
associated with the device context for the window and that has a visible
region equal to the intersection of the window's update region and its
visible region. This means that only those portions of the window that need
to be redrawn are drawn. Attempts to draw outside this region are clipped
and do not appear on the screen.
 
If the application maintains its own presentation space for the window, it
can pass that handle of the presentation space to the WinBeginPaint
function, which modifies the visible region of the presentation space and
passes the presentation-space handle back to the caller. If the application
does not have its own presentation space, it can pass a NULL
presentation-space handle and the system will return a cached-micro
presentation space for the window. In either case, the application can use
the presentation space to draw in the window.
 
The WinBeginPaint function takes a pointer to a RECTL structure that it
fills in with the coordinates of the rectangle enclosing the area to update.
The application can use this rectangle to optimize drawing, by drawing only
those portions of the window that intersect with the rectangle. If an
application passes a NULL pointer for the rectangle argument, the
application draws the entire window and relies on the clipping mechanism to
filter out the unneeded areas.
 
After the WinBeginPaint function sets the update region of a window to NULL,
the application does the drawing necessary to fill the update areas. If an
application handles a WM_PAINT message and does not call WinBeginPaint or
otherwise empty the update region, the application continues to receive
<b>WM_PAINT</b> messages as long as the update region is not empty.
 
Once the application has finished drawing, it should call the WinEndPaint
function to restore the presentation space to its former state. When a
cached-micro presentation space is returned by the WinBeginPaint function,
the presentation space is returned to the system for reuse. If the
application supplies its own presentation space to WinBeginPaint, the
presentation state is restored to its previous state.
 
<b>Drawing the Minimized View</b>
 
When an application creates a standard frame window, it has the option of
specifying an icon that the system will use to represent the application in
its minimized state. Typically, if an icon is supplied, the system draws the
icon in the minimized window and labels the icon with the name of the
window. If the application does not specify the FS_ICON style for the
window, the window receives a WM_PAINT message when it is minimized. The
code in the window procedure that handles the WM_PAINT message can determine
if the frame window is currently minimized and then draw accordingly. Notice
that because the WS_MINIMIZED style is relevant only for the frame window,
not for the client, the window procedure checks the frame window rather than
the client window. The following code fragment shows how to draw a window in
the minimized state and the normal state:
 
case WM_PAINT:
    hps = WinBeginPaint(hwnd, NULL, &amp;rect);
 
    /* See if the frame window (client's parent) is minimized. */
 
    ulStyle = WinQueryWindowULong(WinQueryWindow(hwnd, QW_PARENT,
        FALSE), QWL_STYLE);
 
    if (ulStyle &amp; WS_MINIMIZED) {
        .
        . /* paints the minimized state */
        .
    }
    else {
        .
        . /* paints the normal state    */
        .
    }
    WinEndPaint(hps);
    return 0L;
 
<b>Drawing Without the WM_PAINT Message</b>
 
An application can draw in a window's presentation space if it has not
received a WM_PAINT message. As long as there is a presentation space for
the window, an application can draw into the presentation space an avoid
intruding into other windows or the desktop. Applications that draw without
using the WM_PAINT message typically call the WinGetPS function to obtain a
cached-micro presentation space for the window and call the WinReleasePS
function when they have finished drawing. An application can also use any of
the other types of presentation spaces described in the following sections.
 
<b>Three Kinds of Presentation Spaces</b>
 
All drawing must take place within a presentation space. MS OS/2 provides
three kinds of presentation spaces for drawing: the normal presentation
space, the micro presentation space, and the cached-micro presentation
space.
 
The normal presentation space provides the most functionality, allowing
access to all the graphics functions of MS OS/2 and allowing the application
to draw to all device types. The normal presentation space is more difficult
to use than the other two kinds of presentation spaces and it uses more
memory. It is created by using the GpiCreatePS function and it is destroyed
by using the GpiDestroyPS function.
 
The micro presentation space allows access to only a subset of the MS OS/2
graphics functions, but it uses less memory and is faster than a normal
presentation space. The micro presentation space also allows the application
to draw to all device types. It is created by using the GpiCreatePS function
and destroyed by using the GpiDestroyPS function.
 
The cached-micro presentation space provides the least functionality of the
three kinds of presentation spaces, but it is the most efficient and easiest
to use. The cached-micro presentation space draws only to the screen. It is
created and destroyed by using either the WinBeginPaint and WinEndPaint
functions or the WinGetPS and WinReleasePS functions.
 
The following sections describe each of the three types of presentation
spaces in detail and discuss strategies for using each type in an
application. (For more information, see All three kinds of presentation
spaces can be used in a single application. Some windows, especially if they
will never be printed, are best served by cached-micro presentation spaces.
Other windows may require the more flexible services of micro or normal
presentation spaces.
 
<b>Cached-Micro Presentation Spaces</b>
 
The cached-micro presentation space provides the simplest and most efficient
drawing environment. It can be used only for drawing on the screen,
typically in the context of a window. It is most appropriate for application
tasks that need simple window-drawing functions that do not need to be
printed. Cached-micro presentation spaces do not support retained graphics.
 
After an application draws to a cached-micro presentation space, the drawing
commands are routed through an implied device context to the current
display. The application does not need information about the actual device
context, since it is assumed to be the display. This process makes
cached-micro presentation spaces easy for applications to use.
 
There are two common strategies for using cached-micro presentation spaces
in an application. The simplest is to call the WinBeginPaint function during
the WM_PAINT message, use the resulting cached-micro presentation space to
draw in the window, and then return the presentation space to the system by
calling the WinEndPaint function. By using this method, the application only
interacts with the presentation space when it needs to draw in the
presentation space. This method is most appropriate for simple drawing. A
disadvantage of this method is that the application must set up any special
attributes for the presentation space, such as line color and font, each
time a new presentation space is obtained.
 
A second strategy is for the application to allocate a cached-micro
presentation space during initialization, by calling the WinGetPS function
and saving the resulting presentation-space handle in a static variable. The
application can then set attributes in the presentation space that persist
for the life of the program. The presentation-space handle can be used as an
argument to the WinBeginPaint function each time the window gets a WM_PAINT
message; the system modifies the visible region and returns the presentation
space to the application with its attributes intact. This strategy is
appropriate for applications that need to customize their window-drawing
attributes.
 
A presentation space that is obtained by calling the WinGetPS function
should be released by calling WinReleasePS when the application has finished
using it. (Typically, this will be during program termination.) A
presentation space that is obtained by calling the WinBeginPaint function
should be released by calling the WinEndPaint function, typically as the
last part of processing a WM_PAINT message.
 
<b>Micro Presentation Spaces</b>
 
The main advantage of a micro presentation space over a cached-micro
presentation space is that it can be used for printing as well as for
painting in a window. An applications that uses a micro presentation space
must explicitly associate it with a device context. This makes the micro
presentation space useful for painting to a printer, plotter, or an
off-screen memory bitmap.
 
A micro presentation space does not support the full set of MS OS/2 graphics
functions. Unlike a normal presentation space, a micro presentation space
does not support retained graphics.
 
An application that needs to display in a window and print to a printer or
plotter typically maintains two presentation spaces: one for the window and
one for the printing device.
 
An application creates a micro presentation space by calling the
<b>GpiCreatePS</b> function. Because a device context must be supplied at the time
the micro presentation space is created, an application typically creates a
device context and then a presentation space. The following code fragment
demonstrates this by obtaining a device context for a window and associating
it with a new micro presentation space:
 
hdc = WinOpenWindowDC(...);
hps = GpiCreatePS(...,hdc,...,GPIA_ASSOC);
 
To create a micro presentation space for a device other than the screen,
replace the call to the WinOpenWindowDC function with a call to the
<b>DevOpenDC</b> function, which obtains a device context for a device that is not
the screen. The device context that is obtained by this call can be used as
an argument to the GpiCreatePS function.
 
An application typically creates a micro presentation space during
initialization and uses it until termination. Each time the application
receives a WM_PAINT message, it should pass the handle of the micro
presentation space as an argument to the WinBeginPaint function; this
prevents the system from returning a cached-micro presentation space. The
system modifies the visible region of the supplied micro presentation space
and returns the presentation space to the application. This method allows
the application to use the same presentation space for all drawing in a
specified window.
 
Micro presentation spaces created by using the GpiCreatePS function should
be destroyed by calling the GpiDestroyPS function before the application
terminates. Do not call the WinReleasePS function to release a presentation
space obtained by using the GpiCreatePS function. Before terminating,
applications should also use the DevCloseDC function to close any device
contexts opened by using the DevOpenDC function. No action is necessary for
device contexts obtained with the WinOpenWindowDC function, since the system
automatically closes these device contexts when destroying the associated
windows.
 
<b>Normal Presentation Spaces</b>
 
The normal presentation space supports the full power of MS OS/2 graphics,
including retained graphics. The main advantages of a normal presentation
space over the other two presentation-space types are its support of all
graphics functions, including retained graphics, and its ability to be
associated with many kinds of device contexts.
 
A normal presentation space can be associated with many different device
contexts. Typically, this means that an application creates a normal
presentation space and associates it with a window device context for screen
display. When the user asks to print, the application associates the same
presentation space with a printer device context. Later, the application can
reassociate the presentation space with the window device context. A
presentation space can be associated with only one device context at a time,
but the normal presentation space allows the application to change the
device context whenever necessary.
 
A normal presentation space can be associated with a device context when the
normal presentation space is created, or association can be deferred to a
later time. The GpiAssociate function associates a device context with a
normal presentation space after the presentation space has been created. An
application typically associates the normal presentation space with a device
context when calling the GpiCreatePS function and later associates the
presentation space with a different device context by calling GpiAssociate.
To obtain a device context for a window, call the WinOpenWindowDC function.
To obtain a device context for a device other than the screen, call the
<b>DevOpenDC</b> function.
 
An application typically creates a normal presentation space during
initialization and uses it until termination. Each time the application
receives a WM_PAINT message, it should pass the handle of the normal
presentation space as an argument to the WinBeginPaint function; this
prevents the system from returning a cached-micro presentation space. The
system modifies the visible region of the supplied normal presentation space
and returns the presentation space to the application. This method allows
the application to use the same presentation space for all drawing in a
specified window.
 
Normal presentation spaces created by using the GpiCreatePS function should
be destroyed by calling the GpiDestroyPS function before the application
terminates. Do not call the WinReleasePS function to release a presentation
space obtained by using the GpiCreatePS function. Before terminating,
applications should also use the DevCloseDC function to close any device
contexts opened by using the DevOpenDC function. No action is necessary for
device contexts obtained with the WinOpenWindowDC function, since the system
automatically closes these device contexts when destroying the associated
windows.
 
<b>Printing</b>
 
Although a detailed discussion of printing is beyond the scope of this
topic, printing should be seen as a variation of screen painting. To draw in
a window, an application issues graphics calls to a presentation space
associated with a screen device context. To print, the application makes
graphics calls to a presentation space associated with a printer device
context. In an application that supports a what-you-see-is-what-you-get
window display, the printing code should be the same as or very similar to
the window-display code, as though the printed page were an 8 ½-by-11-inch
window. (Of course, many applications will optimize printing code to take
advantage of such properties of the output device as high-resolution
page-description languages.)
 
An application achieves greater device-independence if it does not use pels
as its drawing unit. For example, if an application does all its drawing
into a presentation space with PU_LOENGLISH units (.01 inch), a 100-unit
line is certain to be one inch long on any printing device. The presentation
space and device context automatically scale a drawing to compensate for the
resolution of the output device.

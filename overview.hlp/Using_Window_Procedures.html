                          Using Window Procedures
 
The following code fragment shows a sample window procedure. It shows how to
use the message argument in a switch statement with individual messages
handled by each case statement. Notice that each case returns a value
specifically for that message. Consult the description of each message to
determine the appropriate return value.
 
The window procedure calls the WinDefWindowProc function for any messages
that it does not handle itself. WinDefWindowProc performs default processing
for essential messages sent to windows.
 
MRESULT EXPENTRY MyWindowProc(hwnd, msg, mp1, mp2)
HWND   hwnd;
USHORT msg;
MPARAM mp1;
MPARAM mp2;
{
    /* local variables */
 
    switch (msg) {
 
        case WM_CREATE:
        /* Initialize private window data. */
 
            return 0L;
 
        case WM_PAINT:
        /* Paint the window. */
 
            return 0L;
 
        case WM_DESTROY:
        /* Clean up private window data. */
 
            return 0L;
 
        default:
            break;
    }
    return (WinDefWindowProc(hwnd, msg, mp1, mp2));
}
 
A dialog procedure is exactly like a window procedure except that it
receives a WM_INITDLG message instead of the WM_CREATE message. A dialog
procedure should pass all unprocessed messages to the WinDefDlgProc function
instead of passing them to the WinDefWindowProc function.
 
It is possible to write a window procedure that passes all messages to
<b>WinDefWindowProc</b>, but the window will have no personality of its own. At the
very least, a window procedure should handle the WM_PAINT message to draw
itself. Typically, it should handle mouse and keyboard messages as well.
Consult the descriptions of individual messages to determine if your window
procedure should handle them.
 
There are times when you may want to create a window that does not change
the default window behavior. That window's sole purpose is to keep track of
its child windows. Object windows are often used this way. An easy way to
create a window that does not change the default window behavior is to
specify the WinDefWindowProc function as your window procedure when
registering the window class. The application then does not write a separate
window procedure for windows of this class.
 
<b>Associating a Window Procedure and Classes</b>
 
A window procedure is associated with a window class by passing a far
pointer to the window procedure to the WinRegisterClass function. Once
registered this way, the window procedure will be associated with each new
window created with that class.
 
The following code fragment shows how to associate a window procedure with a
window class:
 
WinRegisterClass(hab,    /* anchor-block handle      */
    szClassName,         /* class name               */
    MyWindowProc,        /* far pointer to procedure */
    CS_SIZEREDRAW,       /* class style              */
    0);                  /* window data              */
 
Another useful option is to subclass a window of an existing class. This is
most often used to add functionality or to alter the behavior of frame
windows.
 
To subclass a window, call the WinSubclassWindow function. This function
returns a pointer to the window procedure for the window. Subclassing allows
you to process messages using your own window procedure before passing
unprocessed messages to the original window procedure. In this way, you can
use the original window procedure instead of WinDefWindowProc for default
window processing.
 
<b>Processing a Default Window Procedure</b>
 
Typically, you call the WinDefWindowProc function for any messages that are
not handled in your window procedure. For each message handled you should
return an explicit value that depends on the particular message. For all
other messages you should return the WinDefWindowProc function. The
following code fragment shows how to structure a window procedure to call
the default window procedure for any unused messages:
 
switch (usMessage) {
    case WM_PAINT:
        hps = WinBeginPaint(hwnd, NULL, &amp;rect);
        WinFillRect(hps, &amp;rect, CLR_WHITE);
        WinEndPaint(hps);
        return 0L;
    default:
        break;
}
return (WinDefWindowProc(hwnd, usMessage, mp1, mp2));
 
You can also call WinDefWindowProc as part of your own processing of a
window message. In these cases, you may want to modify the parameters to the
message before passing it to WinDefWindowProc, or you may want to continue
with the default processing after performing your own operations.

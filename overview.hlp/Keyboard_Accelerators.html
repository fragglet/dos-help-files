                        About Keyboard Accelerators

Accelerators are keystrokes that generate command messages for an
application; they elicit the same behavior as choosing a menu item. Menus
provide an easy way to learn an application's command set, but accelerators
provide quicker access to those commands.
 
Accelerators filter keyboard input. Accelerator keystrokes are translated
into command messages before they reach the application. When an accelerator
is used, the application receives a command message rather than a keyboard
message.
 
Accelerators function differently from the usual keyboard-to-menu interface.
By default, a user can use the ALT key to access submenus and the ARROW keys
to move along the menu bar. Accelerators provide single keystrokes that
generate command messages without the visual effects of pulling down menus
or stepping from one item to another.
 
Like menu items, accelerators can generate WM_COMMAND, WM_HELP, and
<b>WM_SYSCOMMAND</b> messages, depending on the setting of the accelerator's style
bits. Although accelerators are normally used to generate commands that
already exist as menu items, they can also send commands that have no
equivalent menu items.
 
An accelerator table contains an array of accelerators. Accelerator tables
exist at two levels within MS OS/2. MS OS/2 maintains a single accelerator
table for the system queue and individual accelerator tables for application
windows. Accelerators in the system queue apply to all applications──for
example, the F1 key always generates a WM_HELP message. Having accelerators
for individual application windows ensures that an application can define
its own accelerators without interfering with other applications. An
accelerator for an application window overrides the accelerator in the
system queue. An application can modify both its own accelerator table and
the system accelerator table.
 
<b>Accelerator Tables in a Resource-Definition File</b>
 
An application that uses accelerators typically creates an accelerator table
resource-definition file containing its accelerators and associates that
resource with a standard frame window when the window is created.
 
The resource-definition file of an accelerator table is a list of
accelerator items. Each item defines the keystroke that triggers the
accelerator, the command that the accelerator generates, and the
accelerator's style. The style bits specify whether the keystroke is a
virtual key, a character, or a scan code, and whether the generated message
is WM_COMMAND, WM_SYSCOMMAND, or WM_HELP. (WM_COMMAND is the default
message.)
 
A resource-definition file for an accelerator table is shown in the
following code fragment:
 
ACCELTABLE      ID_ACCEL_RESOURCE
BEGIN
    VK_ESC,     IDM_ED_UNDO,   VIRTUALKEY,  SHIFT
    VK_DELETE,  IDM_ED_CUT,    VIRTUALKEY
    VK_F2,      IDM_ED_COPY,   VIRTUALKEY
    VK_INSERT,  IDM_ED_PASTE,  VIRTUALKEY
END
 
This accelerator table has four accelerator items. The first one is
triggered when the user presses SHIFT+ESC; it sends a WM_COMMAND message
(the default) just as if the IDM_ED_UNDO menu item had been chosen.
 
The accelerator table resource-definition file has a resource-identification
number that is usually the same as the identifier of the application's menu
resource; this allows the accelerator table to be associated with a standard
frame window when the frame window is created. You can also define
accelerator-table resources with other identification numbers and associate
them with windows after the windows are created.
 
<b>Accelerator-Table Data Structures</b>
 
Applications that manipulate accelerator tables can refer to them with a
32-bit handle (HACCEL). Using this handle allows an application to make most
API function calls for accelerators without needing to account for the
internal structures that define the accelerator table. To use accelerator
tables in the default manner, it is sufficient to define the table in the
resource-definition file and associate it with a standard frame window when
creating the window. When an application needs to dynamically create or
change an accelerator table, it must use the ACCEL and ACCELTABLE data
structures.
 
An accelerator table is made up of individual accelerator items. Each item
is represented by an ACCEL data structure that defines the accelerator's
style, keystroke, and command identifier.
 
Typically, an application defines these aspects of the accelerator in the
accelerator's resource-definition file, but the data structure can be built
in memory at run time, if necessary.
 
An accelerator table is made up of one or more accelerator items and
information that specifies the number of accelerator items in the table and
the code page used for the keystrokes in the accelerator items.
 
Notice that the array of accelerator items is defined as having only one
member. Applications that use accelerator-table data structures directly
must allocate sufficient memory to hold all the items in the table.

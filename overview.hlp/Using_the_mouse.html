                              Using the Mouse
 
Since mouse input for Presentation Manager applications is provided
automatically through the message queue, only non-Presentation Manager
programs use the MS OS/2 mouse functions. Typically, you use the mouse
functions in character-based programs that need mouse input. The following
sections explain how to use the mouse functions.
 
<b>Opening the Mouse</b>
 
You can open the mouse by using the MouOpen function. This function requires
the name of the device driver and a pointer to the variable that receives
the mouse handle. The following code fragment opens the mouse by using the
default device driver:
 
HMOU hmou;
 
MouOpen(NULL, &amp;hmou);
    .
    .
    .
MouClose(hmou);
 
In this example, NULL specifies the mouse-device driver designated in the
first device command in the config.sys file. The MouOpen function opens the
mouse and copies a handle to the variable hmou. You can use this handle in
subsequent mouse functions to carry out tasks, such as reading from the
event queue.
 
You can close the mouse by using the MouClose function.
 
<b>Drawing the Mouse Pointer</b>
 
Once you have a mouse handle, you need to display the mouse pointer by using
the MouDrawPtr function. When the mouse is first opened, the mouse pointer
is hidden from view, so even though the user can use the mouse and your
program can process mouse input, there is nothing to tell the user where the
mouse is located. The following code fragment opens the mouse and then
displays the mouse pointer:
 
HMOU hmou;
 
MouOpen(0L, &amp;hmou);
MouDrawPtr(hmou);
    .
    .
    .
 
<b>Hiding the Mouse Pointer</b>
 
If you plan to write to the screen when the mouse pointer is visible, you
must be careful not to write directly over the pointer. The system displays
the pointer by combining the pointer-shape masks with the contents of the
screen at the current pointer position. When the user moves the mouse, the
system restores the previous contents of the screen, destroying whatever is
there. This means that if you write to the screen while the pointer is
visible, what you write will be lost when the mouse next moves.
 
If you need to write to a screen position that is occupied by the mouse
pointer, you can hide the pointer temporarily by using the MouRemovePtr
function. This function specifies an exclusion rectangle. The mouse pointer,
upon moving into this rectangle, disappears. The following code fragment
hides the mouse pointer before writing to the screen:
 
NOPTRRECT mourt;
 
mourt.row = 0;
mourt.col = 0;
mourt.cRow = 24;
mourt.cCol = 79;
 
MouRemovePtr(&amp;mourt, hmou);
VioWrtNChar(&amp;ch, 1, 10, 10, 0);
MouDrawPtr(hmou);
 
The NOPTRRECT structure takes the coordinates of the upper-left corner of
the screen and the width and height of the desired rectangle. This example
specifies the entire screen as the exclusion rectangle, so the program must
use the MouDrawPtr function to redraw the pointer after writing the
character to the screen.
 
<b>Using the Event Queue</b>
 
You can use the MouReadEventQue function to read from the mouse-event queue.
This function copies the next event (if any) in the queue to a MOUEVENTINFO
structure. The structure has four fields: fs, time, row, and col. The fs
field specifies the action that generated the event; for example, if the
mouse moved, the field is set to 0x0001. The row and col fields specify the
location of the mouse when the event occurred. The time field specifies the
system time when the event occurred. If there is no event in the queue when
you call the MouReadEventQue function, the function fills the structure with
zeros. Since zero is a valid value for the fs, row, and col fields, you must
check the time field to see if an event was received (if so, the field is
nonzero).
 
The following sample program opens the mouse and reads events from the
mouse-event queue. Each time the user presses the mouse button, the program
writes the letter A to the location of the mouse pointer on the screen.
 
#define INCL_SUB
#include &lt;os2.h&gt;
 
NOPTRRECT mourt = { 0, 0, 24, 79 };
 
main( )
{
    CHAR ch;
    KBDKEYINFO kbci;
    HMOU hmou;
    MOUEVENTINFO mouev;
    USHORT fWait = MOU_NOWAIT;
 
    ch = ' ';
    VioWrtNChar(&amp;ch, 2000, 0, 0, 0);
    ch = 'A';
 
    MouOpen(0L, &amp;hmou);
    MouDrawPtr(hmou);
 
    do {
        MouReadEventQue(&amp;mouev, &amp;fWait, hmou);
        if (mouev.time) {
            if (mouev.fs &amp; MOUSE_BN1_DOWN) { /* is 1st button down? */
                MouRemovePtr(&amp;mourt, hmou);
                VioWrtNChar(&amp;ch, 1, mouev.row, mouev.col, 0);
                MouDrawPtr(hmou);
            }
        }
        KbdCharIn(&amp;kbci, IO_NOWAIT, 0);
    } while (kbci.chChar != 'Q');
 
    MouClose(hmou);
}
 
After retrieving an event from the queue (and verifying that it is a valid
event), this sample program checks the fs field to see if it contains the
value 0x0004. If it does, then the first mouse button (typically the
leftmost button) is down. The program then hides the pointer and writes the
letter A to the screen. After it restores the mouse pointer, the program
checks the keyboard to determine whether the user has pressed the Q key. The
program continues to read events from the queue until the user presses the Q
key.
 
<b>Specifying the Events to be Queued</b>
 
You may have noticed that the program described in the previous section
seemed to ignore some mouse events if you moved the mouse quickly. The
program was not ignoring the events──it just was not receiving them. The
mouse-event queue is small, and once it is full, any new event bumps the
oldest event from the queue. This means that you may lose information if
your program cannot read from the queue fast enough.
 
One way to minimize the amount of information lost is to exclude certain
events from being placed in the queue. You can do this by using the
<b>MouSetEventMask</b> function. This function lets you disable the mouse events
that you do not wish to process. For example, in the previous program, you
do not need the mouse- motion events, so disabling them would reduce the
chances of losing a button-down event.
 
You disable an event by setting the bits in the event mask for only those
events that you want to process. The following code fragment enables the
first-button-down event but disables all other events:
 
USHORT fsEvents;
 
fsEvents = MOUSE_BN1_DOWN;
 
MouSetEventMask(&amp;fsEvents, hmou);
 
If you disable an event such as a button press, the system does nothing to
the queue if the user presses that button, but it internally records that
button press. If some recordable event occurs while the button is still
down, the system adds this button-down information to the event that it
passes to the queue. In other words, even if you have disabled button-down
events, the fs field in the MOUEVENTINFO structure still indicates when that
button is down.
 
You can retrieve the number of buttons on the mouse by using the
<b>MouGetNumButtons</b> function. This information can help you decide which events
to enable and which to disable.
 
You can use the MouGetNumQueEl function to retrieve the number of events in
the queue. This function retrieves the size of the queue, as well as a count
of the events in the queue. If you decide that you do not need the events
already in the queue, you can flush them from the queue by using the
<b>MouFlushQue</b> function.

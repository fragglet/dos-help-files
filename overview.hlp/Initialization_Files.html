                         About Initialization Files
 
This topic describes the portions of MS OS/2 that let you work with the MS
OS/2 initialization file, os2.ini, that let you add applications to the
switch list in Task Manager and to the program list in Start Programs; and
that let you set colors for and retrieve information about the Presentation
Manager session. You should also be familiar with the following topics:
 
    <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='Profile_Manager.html'>Profile manager</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
The following sections describe the methods used to set and retrieve system
information.
 
<b>The MS OS/2 Initialization File</b>
 
The os2.ini file contains configuration information for both MS OS/2 and
individual applications. MS OS/2 uses information in the file to initialize
the Presentation Manager session when it starts. An application can use the
information to initialize its windows and data when it starts.
 
The os2.ini file is a binary file, so the user cannot view or edit it
directly. The file consists of one or more sections, each section containing
one or more settings, or keys. Each key consists of two parts: a name and a
value. Both key names and section names are null-terminated strings. A key
value can be a null-terminated string, a null-terminated string representing
a signed integer, or individual bytes of data.
 
Each section must have a unique name. Within a section, each key must have a
unique name. The file can contain up to 6120 sections, with 120 sections
reserved for the system. Each section can contain up to 6120 keys.
 
Section names and key names are each limited to 1024 bytes, including a
required terminating null character. Although section names and key names
are typically composed of ASCII characters in the range 0 through 255, they
can actually be any null-terminated sequence of bytes. Each key value is
limited to 65,535 bytes. Individual bytes can have any value, including
zero. Thus, key values can contain any sort of binary data, including but
not limited to null-terminated character strings.
 
The following is an example of the PM_Colors section. It shows the key names
and values stored by Control Panel for system colors.
 
PM_Colors
  Background = 138 117 202
  AppWorkspace = 244 170 181
  Window = 128 128 128
  WindowText = 0 0 0
  WindowStaticText = 0 0 127
  Menu = 128 128 128
  MenuText = 128 0 0
  ActiveTitle = 255 213 138
  InactiveTitle = 47 47 47
  TitleText = 0 128 128
  ActiveBorder = 0 0 0
  InactiveBorder = 186 48 170
  WindowFrame = 0 0 0
  Scrollbar = 48 48 58
  HelpBackground = 255 255 255
  HelpText = 0 0 127
  HelpHilite = 0 127 127
 
Several sections of os2.ini are maintained by the system. The names of these
system sections begin with the characters PM, as in the preceding example,
PM_Colors. Specific applications can add additional sections to os2.ini. The
application name should be part of the section name.
 
Several of the os2.ini functions can be used to enumerate all of the
<i>os2.ini</i> section names or all of a particular section's key names. These
functions copy the section names to a buffer that the application supplies.
The names are copied as a consecutive series of null-terminated character
strings, the last string marked with an additional null byte.
 
<b>The Shell</b>
 
The Start Programs and Task Manager applications let users start and control
applications. The user uses the Start Programs window to start applications
listed in the program list and uses the Task Manager window to switch
between and terminate processes listed in the switch list. The program list
contains the titles of installed applications, organized in groups, and
provides the information the system needs to start those applications. The
switch list contains a list of currently running processes and provides the
information the system needs to switch between and terminate processes.
 
Both the program list and the switch list are accessible from an
application. Typically, though, an application interacts with the switch
list and leaves program-list operations to the user.
 
<b>The Program List</b>
 
Start Programs maintains the program list, which is divided into groups. The
root group, known to the user as the Main Group, is the first group
displayed when Start Programs starts. It is specified in shell functions
with the group-handle constant SGH_ROOT.
 
Applications can create new groups for the program list, add applications to
the list, and retrieve information about applications in the list by using
the WinCreateGroup, WinAddProgram, WinQueryDefinition, and
<b>WinQueryProgramTitles</b> functions. Users can also change and delete
applications from the program list, but applications cannot.
 
When you use these function to create a group or add an application, the
functions return a unique program-list handle. The handle is used in all
subsequent shell functions to identify the group or application.
 
To add an application to the program list, the application must fill a
program-information-block (PIBSTRUCT) structure with information the program
list needs about an application, including a program title, a path and
filename for the executable file, a default directory, and startup
parameters. A pointer to the PIBSTRUCT structure is passed as a
<b>WinAddProgram</b> parameter.
 
The XYWINSIZE structure, used in PIBSTRUCT, is a window-size structure. It
specifies the initial size and position of an application's main window. It
also includes a state variable that can be used to set the window to a
minimized, maximized, invisible, or normal state, as well as to specify
whether the window closes automatically when the application terminates.
 
An application can use the WinQueryProgramTitles function to retrieve
information about an application or group in the program list. This function
copies the information to an array of PROGRAMENTRY structures.
 
<b>The Switch List</b>
 
Task Manager maintains a list of current processes, or tasks. This list is
called the switch list. An application should register with the switch list
before entering its main message loop. Task Manager displays current
switch-list tasks to the user. After an application registers with the
switch list, a title string representing the task appears in the Task
Manager window.
 
To avoid confusion, an application's switch-list title string should match
the string that appears in its main window's title bar. If an application
changes its main window's title bar string during operation──for example, to
append the name of an open file──it should change its switch-list entry as
well by using the WinChangeSwitchEntry function.
 
<b>System Colors and Values</b>
 
MS OS/2 provides system-wide values that an application can use to help
determine the color and dimensions of windows and other objects it draws in
its client area. These values are also used by frame windows to set the
colors and sizes for title bars, scroll bars, sizing borders, and other
frame controls and elements associated with a frame window.
 
If an application changes the system colors and values, the change affects
all applications.
 
<b>System Colors</b>
 
The system colors are a set of colors that MS OS/2 uses to draw windows. The
system colors are associated with the elements of the Presentation Manager
session, such as the desktop, title bars, scroll bars, text, and window
background. Typically, the system sets the colors of these elements to
default values when it first starts. The user can change the values at any
time by using the Control Panel application. Any changes the user makes to
the system colors are written to both the system logical color table and the
<i>os2.ini</i> file. Applications can use the system color values to draw elements
in their own client windows.
 
MS OS/2 maintains 17 system colors. A set of symbolic constants, defined in
the MS OS/2 include files identifies these colors. These symbolic constants
have the prefix SYSCLR and can be used like other color indexes when an
application draws in a client window. The following list gives the SYSCLR
constants, and their meanings:
 
<b>Value                    Meaning</b>
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
<i>SYSCLR_BACKGROUND</i>        Desktop background
 
<i>SYSCLR_WINDOWFRAME</i>       Window frame
 
<i>SYSCLR_TITLETEXT</i>         Title-bar text
 
<i>SYSCLR_ACTIVETITLE</i>       Active window title-bar background
 
<i>SYSCLR_INACTIVETITLE</i>     Inactive window title-bar background
 
<i>SYSCLR_MENUTEXT</i>          Menu text
 
<i>SYSCLR_MENU</i>              Menu background
 
<i>SYSCLR_WINDOWTEXT</i>        Window text
 
<i>SYSCLR_WINDOWSTATICTEXT</i>  Window static text
 
<i>SYSCLR_WINDOW</i>            Window background
 
<i>SYSCLR_APPWORKSPACE</i>      Multiple-document-interface window background
 
<i>SYSCLR_SCROLLBAR</i>         Scroll-bar shaft
 
<i>SYSCLR_ACTIVEBORDER</i>      Active border
 
<i>SYSCLR_INACTIVEBORDER</i>    Inactive border
 
<i>SYSCLR_HELPTEXT</i>          Help-window text
 
<i>SYSCLR_HELPHILITE</i>        Help-window highlighted text
 
<i>SYSCLR_HELPBACKGROUND</i>    Help-window background
 
The system stores system-color data in the PM_Colors section of the os2.ini
file. Each system color has a key in that section. Each key value is an
ASCII string of three integer values in the range 0 through 255, separated
by spaces. The integers represent the red, green, and blue components of an
RGB color value, in that order.
 
An application can query and set system colors by using the
<b>WinQuerySysColor and WinSetSysColors functions. </b>Changes made with
<b>WinSetSysColors</b> are not permanent, since they are not written to the
PM_Colors section of the os2.ini file. To make permanent system-color
changes, you must explicitly write to the PM_Colors section of the os2.ini
file by using the WinWriteProfileString and WinWriteProfileData functions.
Remember that changes in the system colors affect all applications.
 
MS OS/2 specifies colors with 24 bits of red-green-blue intensity
information, 8 bits for each color. An intensity value can be any value in
the range 0 through 255. The 3 bytes are packed into a 4-byte long integer;
the fourth byte is currently unused. Although a device may be capable of
producing many colors, it typically does not give access to all colors at
all times. Instead, it gives access to the number of colors that can fit in
an array called the physical palette. Each system-color index maps to one of
the entries in the physical palette. When an application changes a system
color, it specifies a new RGB value. The system then finds the closest
matching color in the physical palette and maps the corresponding
system-color index to the new palette entry. How closely the new color
matches the color the application requested depends on the current contents
of the physical palette.
 
When an application changes the current system colors by using the
<b>WinSetSysColors function, that function sends</b> a WM_SYSCOLORCHANGE message to
all top-level windows. In addition, it invalidates the desktop window,
triggering redrawing of all windows. If color variables in your application
are based on the system colors, you can process the WM_SYSCOLORCHANGE
message and adjust them.
 
<b>System Values</b>
 
The system values, maintained by MS OS/2, determine various system
attributes that affect the appearance and behavior of elements of the
system. These system values can be read and changed by an application.
 
The system values are referred to with predefined constants that have the
prefix SV. For a list of system values, see the <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='../unknown.html#sv_'>System values</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span> topic.
 
The WinQuerySysValue function lets you read a system value, and the
<b>WinSetSysValue</b> function lets you set a system value. Both functions specify
the target system value with a system-value constant.
 
Setting a system value with WinSetSysValue does just that, and no more.
Active processes are not automatically notified of the change. For example,
if an application changes the dimensions of frame-window sizing borders by
resetting SV_CXSIZEBORDER and SV_CYSIZEBORDER, currently existing frame
windows do not automatically reflect the change. To notify other processes
of a change to a system value, an application must send a
<b>WM_SYSVALUECHANGED</b> message. An application that relies on one or more system
values should either read them each time they are used or process
<b>WM_SYSVALUECHANGED</b> messages.
 
When the system starts, the system values are set to default values embedded
in the system code. With a few exceptions, the system does not store system
values in the os2.ini file, so any changes that you make to system values
are lost when the system shuts down.
 
The system values that are stored in os2.ini by Control Panel are
SV_CXBORDER, SV_CYBORDER, SV_CURSORRATE, SV_ALARM and SV_DBLCLKTIME. These
values are kept in the PM_ControlPanel section under the key names
BorderWidth, CursorBlinkRate, and DoubleClickSpeed.
 
<b>System-Value Data Types</b>
 
For convenience, WinQuerySysValue and WinSetSysValue pass system values as
long integers. However, many system values are actually short integers, and
others are Boolean values. Each of these types can be cast to and from a
long integer without losing data.

                              Using Processes
 
To work successfully with multitasking, you need to understand clearly the
difference between a process and a thread. A process is simply the code,
data, and other resources of a program in memory, such as the open files,
allocated memory, and so on. MS OS/2 considers every program that it loads
to be a process. A thread, which is everything else required to execute the
program, consists of a stack, the state of the CPU registers, and an entry
in the execution list of the system scheduler. Every process has at least
one thread, and the program executes when the system scheduler gives the
thread execution control.
 
<b>Starting a Process</b>
 
You can start a process by using the DosExecPgm function. The process you
start is a child of the starting, or parent, process and inherits many of
the resources owned by the parent process, such as open files.
 
The following code fragment starts a program named abc:
 
UCHAR szModuleName[CCHMAXPATH];
RESULTCODES resc;
 
DosExecPgm(szModuleName,    /* object-name buffer */
    sizeof(szModuleName),   /* length of buffer   */
    EXEC_SYNC,              /* sync flag          */
    NULL,                   /* argument string    */
    NULL,                   /* environment string */
    &amp;resc,                  /* address of result  */
    "abc.exe");             /* name of program    */
 
This example starts abc so that it runs synchronously (as specified by the
EXEC_SYNC constant). This means that the parent process temporarily stops
while the child process executes and does not continue until the child
process ends.
 
The MS OS/2 command processor, cmd.exe, is an example of a program that uses
the EXEC_SYNC constant to start most child processes. That is, the processor
waits for each child process to end before it prompts the user for the next
command. The command processor also lets the user start asynchronous
programs by using the detach command. When the user detaches a program, the
command processor places the program in the background and continues to
prompt for input.
 
<b>Setting the Program Command Line and Environment</b>
 
When you start a process, it inherits the resources of the parent. This
includes open files, such as the standard-input and standard-output files. A
child process also inherits the resources of the screen group, such as the
mouse and video modes, and the environment variables of the parent process.
 
The DosExecPgm function determines the command line and environment that the
child process receives. The fourth and fifth parameters of the function are
pointers to the command line and the environment, respectively. If these
pointers are NULL, the child process receives nothing for a command line and
only an exact duplicate of the parent process's environment. The parent
process can modify this information by creating a string (ending with two
null characters) and passing the address of the string to the function. The
command-line string must include the name of the application, followed by a
null character, and the command-line arguments, followed by two null
characters. The following code fragment passes to the child process the
string "test -option1 -option2" as its command line:
 
RESULTCODES resc;
UCHAR szFailName[CCHMAXPATH];
 
UCHAR szCommandLine[] = { "test\0-option1 -option2\0" };
 
DosExecPgm(szFailName,      /* object-name buffer  */
    sizeof(szFailName),     /* length of buffer    */
    EXEC_SYNC,              /* sync flag           */
    szCommandLine,          /* argument string     */
    (PSZ) NULL,             /* environment string  */
    &amp;resc,                  /* address of result   */
   "test.exe");             /* name of application */
 
Any number of arguments can be passed to the child process, as long as the
argument string ends with two null characters.
 
<b>Running an Asynchronous Child Process</b>
 
You can use the EXEC_ASYNC constant in the DosExecPgm function to start a
child process and let it run asynchronously (that is, without causing the
parent process to pause until the child process ends). If you start a
process in this way, the function copies the process identifier of the child
process to the codeTerminate field of the RESULTCODES structure. You can use
this process identifier to check the progress of the child process or to
terminate the process.
 
You can also run a child process asynchronously by using DosExecPgm with the
EXEC_ASYNCRESULT constant. This constant has the same effect as EXEC_ASYNC,
except that it also directs MS OS/2 to save a copy of the child process's
termination status when the child process terminates. This status specifies
the reason that the child process stopped. The parent process can retrieve
the termination status by using the DosCwait function.
 
<b>Waiting for a Child Process to End</b>
 
You can synchronize the execution of a process with the execution of one of
its child processes by using the DosCwait function. When a process calls the
<b>DosCwait</b> function, the function waits until the specified child process has
finished before returning. This can be useful, for example, if the parent
process needs to ensure that the child process has completed its task before
the parent process continues with its own task.
 
In the following code fragment, the parent process waits for the child
process that is specified by the process identifier in the variable
pidChild:
 
RESULTCODES resc;
PID pidParent;
PID pidChild;
 
DosCwait(DCWA_PROCESS, DCWW_WAIT, &amp;resc, &amp;pidParent, pidChild);
 
You can cause a process to wait for all child processes to end by using the
constant DCWA_PROCESSTREE in the DosCwait function.
 
<b>Retrieving the Termination Status of a Child Process</b>
 
MS OS/2 saves the termination status for a process if the process was
started by using DosExecPgm with the EXEC_ASYNCRESULT constant. You can
retrieve the termination status of the most recently terminated process by
using the DCWW_NOWAIT constant with the DosCwait function. This constant
directs the function to return immediately, without waiting for a process to
end. Instead, the function retrieves the termination status from the most
recent process to end.
 
<b>Ending a Process</b>
 
You can exit from a process by using the DosExit function. When you exit
from a process, the system stops the process and frees any existing
resources that it owns. If no other invocation of the process is running,
the system frees the code and data segments of the process.
 
In the following code fragment, the DosExit function is used to exit from
the process if the given file does not exist:
 
VOID cdecl main( )
{
    HFILE hf;
    USHORT usAction, cbWritten;
 
    usError = DosOpen("sample.txt", &amp;hf, &amp;usAction, 0L, FILE_NORMAL,
        FILE_OPEN, OPEN_ACCESS_WRITEONLY | OPEN_SHARE_DENYWRITE, 0L);
 
    if (usError) {
        DosWrite(2, "Cannot open file\r\n", 18, &amp;cbWritten);
        DosExit(EXIT_PROCESS, usError);
    }
}
 
The EXIT_PROCESS constant directs the function to exit not just from the
process, but from the thread that is calling the function as well. The
<b>DosExit</b> function includes an error code that is returned to the parent
process through the RESULTCODES structure specified in the DosExecPgm
function that started the process. If you started the program from the
command line, the command processor (cmd.exe) makes this value available
through the ERRORLEVEL variable. If another process started the program,
that process can call the DosCwait function to retrieve the error-code
value.
 
If you want to exit only from a given thread, you can use the DosExit
function with the EXIT_THREAD constant. This call exits from the thread
without affecting other threads in the process. If the thread that you exit
from also happens to be the last thread in the process, the process also
exits. If the thread consists of a function, the thread exits when the
function returns.
 
<b>Terminating Another Process</b>
 
One process can terminate the execution of another process by using the
<b>DosKillProcess</b> function. The following code fragment terminates the
specified process and all child processes belonging to that process:
 
PID pidProcess;
 
DosKillProcess(DKP_PROCESSTREE, pidProcess);
 
In this example, the pidProcess variable specifies which process to
terminate. Typically, you would assign the variable the process identifier
for the child process. This is the process identifier that is returned by
the DosExecPgm function when you start the child process.
 
<b>Cleaning Up Before Ending a Process</b>
 
Since in MS OS/2 any process can terminate any other process for which it
has a process identifier, there is a chance that your program may lose
information if a process terminates the program before the program can save
its work. To prevent this loss of data, you can create a list of exit
functions that clean up data and your files before MS OS/2 terminates a
process. The system calls the functions on the list whenever your program is
being terminated, whether by another process or by itself.
 
You create an exit list by using the DosExitList function. The function
requires a function code that specifies an action to take and a pointer to
the function that is to receive control upon termination. The following code
fragment adds the locally defined function SaveFiles to the exit list:
 
#define INCL_SUB
#define INCL_DOSPROCESS
#include &lt;os2.h&gt;
 
VOID cdecl main() {
    DosExitList(EXLST_ADD, SaveFiles);
    .
    .
    .
}
 
VOID PASCAL FAR SaveFiles(usTermCode)
USHORT usTermCode;
{
    switch (usTermCode) {
        case TC_EXIT:
        case TC_KILLPROCESS:
            VioWrtTTY("Good-bye\r\n", 10, 0);
            break;
 
        case TC_HARDERROR:
        case TC_TRAP:
            break;
 
    }
    DosExitList(EXLST_EXIT, 0);
}
 
Any function that you add to the exit list must be declared with the far
attribute and must have one parameter. The function can carry out any task,
as shown in the preceding example, but as its last action it must call the
<b>DosExitList</b> function, specifying the EXLST_EXIT constant. An exit-list
function must not return and must not call the DosExit function to
terminate.
 
To execute the exit-list functions, MS OS/2 reassigns thread 1 after
terminating any other threads in the process. If thread 1 has already exited
(for example, if it called the DosExit function without terminating other
threads in the process), then the exit-list functions cannot be executed. In
general, it is poor practice to terminate thread 1 without terminating all
other threads.
 
You can use DosExitList with the EXLST_REMOVE constant to remove a function
from the exit list.
 
<b>Using Threads</b>
 
Every process has at least one thread, called the main thread or thread 1.
To execute different parts of a program simultaneously, you can start
several threads.
 
A new thread inherits all the resources currently owned by the process. This
means that if you opened a file before creating the thread, that file is
available to the thread. Similarly, if the new thread creates or opens a
resource, such as another file, that resource is available to the other
threads in the process.
 
<b>Creating a Thread</b>
 
You can use the DosCreateThread function to create a new thread for a
process. To do so, you need the address of the code to execute, the address
of the first byte in a stack, and a variable to receive the identifier of
the thread. The address of the code is typically the address of a function
that is defined within the program. The address of the stack can be either
an address within a variable declared by using the data segment of the
process or an address in a separate segment. To ensure that the new thread's
stack will not be written over by other threads, you must not declare the
stack within the stack segment of a process. You must also be sure that
there is adequate space on the stack. The amount of space needed depends on
a number of factors, including the number of function calls the thread makes
and the number of parameters and local variables used by each function. If
you plan to call MS OS/2 functions, a reasonable stack size is 4096 bytes.
 
The following code fragment creates a thread:
 
BYTE abStack[4096];
TID tidThread;
 
VOID main() {
    DosCreateThread(ThreadFunc, &amp;tidThread, abStack + sizeof(abStack));
    .
    .
    .
}
 
VOID FAR ThreadFunc(VOID)
{
    VioWrtTTY("Message from new thread\r\n", 25, 0);
}
 
In this example, the array absStack is used for the new thread's stack. The
thread identifier is copied to the tidThread variable. The thread starts
execution with the first statement in the locally defined function
ThreadFunc.
 
In MS OS/2, all stacks grow down in memory──that is, the first byte of the
stack is in high memory and the last byte is in low memory──so you need to
specify the last word in the stack (in this case, absStack[2048]) when you
supply the starting address of the stack in the call to DosCreateThread.
 
A thread continues to run until it calls the DosExit function or returns
control to the operating system. In the preceding example, the thread exits
when the function implicitly returns control at the end of the function.
 
<b>Controlling the Execution of a Thread</b>
 
The DosSuspendThread and DosResumeThread functions let you temporarily
suspend the execution of a thread if you do not need it and then resume
execution when you do need it. These functions are best used when a process
needs to temporarily suspend execution of a thread that is in the middle of
a task. For example, consider a thread that opens and reads files from the
disk. If other threads in the process do not need input from these files,
the process can suspend execution of the thread so that the system scheduler
does not needlessly grant execution control to the thread.
 
<b>Suspending a Thread</b>
 
You can temporarily suspend the execution of a thread for a set interval of
time by using the DosSleep function. This function suspends execution of the
thread for the specified number of milliseconds. DosSleep is useful if you
need to delay the execution of a task. For example, you can use DosSleep to
delay response to the user's pressing a DIRECTION key. This gives the user
time to observe the results and release the key. The following code fragment
uses DosSleep to suspend execution of a thread for 1000 milliseconds (1
second):
 
DosSleep(1000L);
 
<b>Changing the Priority</b>
 
You can use the DosSetPrty function to change the execution priority of
threads in a process. The execution priority defines when or how often a
thread receives an execution time slice. Threads with higher priorities
receive time slices before those with lower priorities. Threads with equal
priority receive time slices in a round-robin order. If you raise the
priority of a thread, the thread will execute more frequently.
 
You can set the priority for just one thread in a process, for all threads
in a process (and thus for the process itself), or for all threads in a
process and in its child processes. The following code fragment uses
<b>DosSetPrty</b> to lower the priority of a process that is intended to be used as
a background process:
 
PIDINFO pidi;
 
DosGetPID(&amp;pidi);
DosSetPrty(PRTYS_PROCESS, PRTYC_IDLETIME, 0, pidi.pid);
 
The DosGetPID function retrieves the process and thread identifiers and
copies them to the pid and tid fields in a PIDINFO structure. The
<b>DosSetPrty</b> function then uses the process identifier to change the priority
to idle-time (idle-time processes receive the least attention by the
scheduler).
 
You can also retrieve the priority of a process or thread by using the
<b>DosGetPrty</b> function. For example, the following code fragment copies the
priority of the process specified by pidiInfo.pid to the usPriority
variable:
 
DosGetPrty(PRTYS_PROCESS, &amp;usPriority, pidiInfo.pid);

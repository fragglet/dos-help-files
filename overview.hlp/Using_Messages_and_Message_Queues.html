                     Using Messages and Message Queues
 
This section explains how to use the message and message-queue functions to
create and manage message queues and to post and send messages between
windows.
 
<b>Creating a Message Queue and Message Loop</b>
 
Your application needs a message queue and message loop to process messages
for your windows. You create a message queue by using the WinCreateMsgQueue
function. You create a message loop by using the WinGetMsg and
<b>WinDispatchMsg</b> functions. You must create and show at least one window after
creating the queue but before starting the message loop. The window is
required because it is the only way the user can supply input to the message
queue. The following code fragment shows how to create a message queue and a
message loop:
 
HAB hab;      /* anchor-block handle     */
HMQ hmq;      /* message-queue handle    */
QMSG qmsg;    /* queue-message structure */
 
VOID cdecl main()
{
    hab = WinInitialize(0);
    hmq = WinCreateMsgQueue(hab, DEFAULT_QUEUE_SIZE);
 
        /*
         * Use WinRegisterClass to register your window class. Use
         * WinCreateStdWindow to create your window.
         */
 
    while (WinGetMsg(hab, &amp;qmsg, NULL, 0, 0))
        WinDispatchMsg(hab, &amp;qmsg);
 
    /* Use WinDestroyWindow to destroy your window. */
 
    WinDestroyMsgQueue(hmq);
    WinTerminate(hab);
}
 
Both the WinGetMsg and WinDispatchMsg functions take a pointer to a QMSG
structure as a parameter. If a message is available, WinGetMsg copies it to
the QMSG structure; WinDispatchMsg then uses the fields of the structure as
arguments for the window procedure.
 
Occasionally, you may need to process the message before dispatching it.
This can occur, for example, if a window procedure posts a message to the
queue for which a NULL window handle has been specified. Because the
<b>WinDispatchMsg</b> function needs a window handle to dispatch the message, the
message loop must process the message before dispatching it. The following
code fragment shows how the message loop might process messages that have
NULL window handles:
 
while (WinGetMsg(hab, &amp;qmsg, NULL, 0, 0)) {
    If (qmsg.hwnd == NULL) {
        .
        . /* Process the message. */
        .
    }
    else
        WinDispatchMsg(hab, &amp;qmsg);
}
 
<b>Examining the Message Queue</b>
 
You can examine the contents of the message queue by using the WinPeekMsg or
<b>WinQueryQueueStatus</b> function. It is useful to examine the queue if you start
a lengthy operation that additional user input can affect, or if you need to
look ahead in the queue to anticipate a response to user input.
 
You can use the WinPeekMsg function to check for specific messages in the
message queue. The function is useful for extracting messages for a specific
window from the queue. The function returns immediately if there is no
message in the queue. This function can be used in a loop without requiring
the loop to wait for a message to arrive. The following code segment checks
the queue for WM_CHAR messages:
 
if (WinPeekMsg(hab, &amp;qmsg, NULL, WM_CHAR, WM_CHAR, PM_NOREMOVE))
 
You can also use the WinQueryQueueStatus function to check for messages in
the queue. This function is very fast and returns information about the
kinds of messages available in the queue and which messages have been
recently posted. Most applications use this function in program loops that
need to be as fast as possible.
 
If you have a very long operation to carry out, you should consider creating
a separate thread for the operation. Despite the MS OS/2 multitasking
features, any application thread having a message queue that does not
periodically relinquish control by calling the WinGetMsg or WinWaitMsg
function risks monopolizing the CPU and seriously degrading system
performance.
 
<b>Posting a Message to a Window</b>
 
You can use the WinPostMsg function to post a message to a window. The
message goes to the window's message queue. For example, the following code
fragment posts the WM_QUIT message:
 
if (!WinPostMsg(hwnd, WM_QUIT, 0L, 0L))
 
    /* Message was not posted. */
 
The function returns FALSE if the queue was full and the message could not
be posted.
 
<b>Sending a Message to a Window</b>
 
You can use the WinSendMsg function to send a message directly to a window.
Applications typically use this function to send messages to child windows.
For example, the following code fragment directs a button control to draw a
check mark by sending the BM_SETCHECK message to the control:
 
WinSendMsg(hwndButton, BM_SETCHECK, MPFROMSHORT(1), 0L);
 
<b>WinSendMsg</b> calls the window's window procedure and waits for that procedure
to handle the message and return a result. A message can be sent to any
window in the system; all that is required is a handle to the window. The
message is not stored in the message queue. The thread making the call must
have a message queue.
 
<b>Broadcasting a Message</b>
 
You can send messages to multiple windows by using the WinBroadcastMsg
function. This function is useful for broadcasting the WM_SYSVALUECHANGED
message after an application changes a system value. The following code
fragment shows how to broadcast this message to all frame windows in all
applications:
 
WinBroadcastMsg(
    hwnd,                                /* window handle         */
    WM_SYSVALUECHANGED,                  /* message id            */
    0L,                                  /* no message parameters */
    0L,
    BMSG_FRAMEONLY | BMSG_POSTQUEUE);    /* all frame windows     */
 
You can broadcast messages to all windows, to just frame windows, or to just
the windows in your application.
 
<b>Using Message Macros</b>
 
The MS OS/2 include files define several macros that help create and
interpret message parameters.
 
One set of macros helps you construct message parameters. Macros are useful
for sending and posting messages. For example, the following code fragment
uses the MPFROMSHORT macro to convert a 16-bit integer into the 32-bit
message parameter:
 
WinSendMsg(hwndButton, BM_SETCHECK, MPFROMSHORT(1), 0L);
 
A second set of macros helps you extract values from a message parameter.
They are useful for handling messages in a window procedure. The following
code fragment illustrates this:
 
case WM_FOCUSCHANGE:
    fsFocusChange = SHORT2FROMMP(mp2);
    if (SHORT1FROMMP(mp2))
         hwndLoseFocus = HWNDFROMMP(mp1);
 
A third set of macros helps you construct a message result. They are useful
for returning message results in a window procedure. This is illustrated by
the following code fragment:
 
return (MRFROM2SHORT(1, 2));

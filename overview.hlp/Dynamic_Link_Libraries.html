                        About Dynamic-Link Libraries
 
This topic describes the portions of MS OS/2 that allow you to dynamically
link functions in dynamic-link libraries to your programs. It also describes
how to build dynamic-link libraries. You should also be familiar with the
following topic:

Dynamic linking is a way for a program to gain access at run time to
functions that are not part of the program's executable code. With dynamic
linking, a program loads a dynamic-link library (also called a module),
retrieves the address of a function in that library, and calls the function
to carry out a task.
 
Any application can use the functions contained in a dynamic-link library.
The only requirement is that you must import the function name so that the
reference can be resolved when you run the application. There are three ways
to import the name of a dynamic-link function:
 
♦  Specify the import library of the dynamic-link library during linking.
 
♦  Specify the function name in the IMPORTS statement of the application's
   module-definition file.
 
♦  Use the MS OS/2 dynamic-link functions to import the function during
   execution of the application.
 
For most applications, function names are resolved by using an import
library. For example, the file os2.lib is an import library that contains
import records for all the MS OS/2 functions. Because much of the code for
MS OS/2 is in dynamic-link libraries, the import library is needed to
prepare MS OS/2 programs for execution.
 
The IMPORTS statement in a program's module-definition file is similar to
the import library, except that you must supply the information needed by
the linker to build the import records of the functions you use.
 
The MS OS/2 dynamic-link functions let a program load dynamic-link libraries
and import functions while the program runs. Although the dynamic-link
functions can be used to import any functions (including the MS OS/2 system
functions), they are more often used to import functions in device drivers
or in special-purpose libraries. Using an import library or the IMPORTS
statement is more common than using the dynamic-link functions, since in
those cases MS OS/2 automatically loads and links the specified function for
you.
 
You can load any number of dynamic-link libraries and create links to any of
the functions in the libraries. It is a good idea to free libraries whenever
you are not using them, however, since this frees memory and avoids
unnecessary swapping.
 
<b>Building Dynamic-Link Libraries</b>
 
This section describes how to build a dynamic-link library. A dynamic-link
library usually contains executable code for common functions. With standard
libraries, such as the C-language run-time library, the code for common
functions is combined with the program code when the program is created, but
with a dynamic-link library the code is not combined. Instead, the program
contains nothing more than an import record of the function and the name of
the dynamic-link library containing it. The function is not linked until the
program needs it.
 
Using a dynamic-link library saves memory, since the library is loaded only
once. All programs that use functions in the library share the library's
code. To avoid conflicts, each program uses its own stack when calling a
library function.
 
After creating the dynamic-link library, remember to copy it to one of the
directories specified by the libpath command in your config.sys file.
 
<b>The Source File</b>
 
The following simple dynamic-link-library source file, dynlink.c,
illustrates how a dynamic-link library is built:
 
#include &lt;os2.h&gt;
int _acrtused = 0;
 
EXPENTRY Sample(pchString, cbLength)
PCH pchString;
USHORT cbLength;
{
    USHORT usBytes;
    DosWrite(1, pchString, cbLength, &amp;usBytes);
}
 
As with all MS OS/2 programs, the os2.h file is included in the library
(since the DosWrite function is called). Notice that the _acrtused variable
is declared and initialized to zero. This directs the linker not to load the
<i>crt0</i> start-up module, which is not needed with dynamic-link libraries.
 
The function Sample is declared with the EXPENTRY attribute. This attribute,
defined in the os2.h file, identifies the function as an export entry.
Export entries use the Pascal calling conventions and require a far call to
invoke them. The far call is necessary because a dynamic-link library always
resides in a different segment from that of the calling program.
 
Dynamic-link libraries can contain either global or local variables. If your
library uses global variables, the data segment of the calling program must
be pushed on the stack and then reloaded with the library's own data
segment. The calling program's data segment must be restored before control
returns from the library. Compilers such as the Microsoft C Optimizing
Compiler provide command-line options and special keywords to automatically
insert the code needed to push and pop the data segment. Strings are always
treated as global variables.
 
Dynamic-link libraries must not assume that the stack and the global data
are located in the same segment. Since a calling program must use its own
stack when calling a function in a dynamic-link library, the ss register
will not be equal to the ds register if the dynamic-link library has its own
data segment.
 
You must not include stack probes when compiling a dynamic-link library.
Because the stack setup for dynamic-link libraries differs from the stack
setup for MS OS/2 programs, stack checking would cause unpredictable
results.
 
<b>The Module-Definition File</b>
 
Each dynamic-link library must use export definitions to make its functions
directly available to other modules. You supply an export definition for a
dynamic-link library in its module-definition file.
 
A module-definition file describes the name, attributes, exports, imports,
and other characteristics of a program or library for MS OS/2. This file is
optional for MS OS/2 programs but is required for dynamic-link libraries.
 
For example, the dynamic-link library dynlink.dll contains the function
Sample, which can be called from other programs. To make Sample available to
calling programs, the module-definition file dynlink.def contains the
following lines:
 
LIBRARY DYNLINK
EXPORTS SAMPLE
 
The LIBRARY statement tells the linker that the file dynlink is a
dynamic-link library. The EXPORTS statement tells the linker that the
function Sample in dynlink is available for other programs to call. (The
Microsoft C Optimizing Compiler converts the names of functions that use the
Pascal calling conventions to uppercase letters.) A program that calls the
dynamic-link library dynlink must specify an import definition for Sample
(unless an import library for dynlink exists) by using the following
<b>IMPORTS</b> statement in the program's module-definition file:
 
IMPORTS DYNLINK.SAMPLE
 
You must list every function that will be called at run time in the
module-definition file of the dynamic-link library.
 
<b>Import Libraries</b>
 
An alternative way to specify import definitions is to create an import
library. If you have many functions in a dynamic-link library, it is usually
easier to create an import library than to use import definitions. The
import library os2.lib is an example of an import library that is linked
with all MS OS/2 applications.
 
To generate an import library, you must first create a module-definition
file for the dynamic-link library. As in the preceding example, this file
should contain LIBRARY and EXPORTS statements. Once you have created the
module-definition file, use the Microsoft Import Library Manager (implib) to
create an import library to use during linking.
 
For example, to create the import library dynlink.lib for the dynamic-link
library dynlink.dll, run implib as follows:
 
implib dynlink.lib dynlink.def
 
If your program makes calls to the newly created dynamic-link library, its
import-library name must be included in the library field of the linker
command line. For example, if the program dcall calls dynlink.dll, link
<b>dcall</b> with the library as follows:
 
link /noi dcall.obj,,,os2.lib dynlink.lib,dcall.def
 
You can also use assembly language to write a dynamic-link library. If you
choose to do so, you must declare each function in your library as follows:
 
<i>functionname proc far</i>
 
You should also declare the functions to be public.
 
Your assembly-language dynamic-link-library functions must set up a stack
frame for the parameters being passed to them. To set up the stack frame, a
function must do the following:
 
♦  Set up the frame pointer (bp).
 
♦  Set up space for local variables.
 
♦  Save the old ds register and set up the data segment for your
   dynamic-link library.
 
♦  Save the si, di, and ss registers (if the values will be changed).
 
♦  Push MS OS/2 parameters on the stack.
 
The function must first set up a frame pointer by pushing the old bp
register value on the stack and setting the bp register equal to the sp
register, as follows:
 
push    bp
mov     bp,sp
 
After pushing the old ds register value on the stack and setting the bp
register equal to the sp register, the function must move the stack pointer
down and push local variables on the stack in they are needed. For example,
the following lines save the old bp value, assign the bp register to sp, and
move sp so that it points to local variables:
 
push    bp
mov     bp,sp
sub     sp,04
 
Local variables are pushed on the stack in the positions (bp-2), (bp-4),
(bp-6), and so on. Thus, you can use these addresses to access the
variables.
 
Before returning to the calling program, the function should restore sp by
setting it equal to bp.
 
If you are creating a dynamic-link library that has an automatic data
segment, each function must set the ds register to the proper value when it
starts. To do this, the function should set DGROUP so that it points to the
data segment of the dynamic-link library, as follows:
 
DGROUP  GROUP   data
 
Each function in the dynamic-link library that needs to use the library's
automatic data segment must save the old data segment and reload the ds
register so that it points to the data segment of the dynamic-link library.
Placed at the beginning of the function, the following lines of code do
this:
 
push    ds
mov     ax, seg DGROUP
mov     ds,ax
 
Before the function returns to the calling program, it must restore the old
<b>ds</b> register value by popping it off the stack, as follows:
 
pop     ds
 
Functions that use the si, di, and ss registers should save the old register
values by pushing them on the stack, after setting the frame pointer and
allocating any existing local data. The following example shows how to push
these registers on the stack:
 
push    bp
mov     bp,sp
sub     sp,4
push    si
push    di
push    ss
 
Before returning to the calling program, the function must pop the registers
off the stack in reverse order, as follows:
 
pop     ss
pop     di
pop     si
 
Since MS OS/2 uses the Pascal calling convention to pass parameters to the
MS OS/2 system functions, it is recommended that you use the same convention
for the dynamic-link-library functions that you create. Although the Pascal
calling convention is not required, it provides a consistent interface for
programs that call functions in dynamic-link libraries. If the Pascal
calling convention is used, applications must push parameters on the stack
before calling the dynamic-link-library function. (Under the Pascal
convention, the number of parameters required by a given function is
fixed.)
 
When the calling program exits from a function for which parameters were
pushed on the stack, the called function should always restore the ds and
<b>bp registers a</b>nd then use a ret nn instruction, where nn is the number of
bytes pushed upon entry.
 
Return values are returned in the ax (16-bit) register or in the dx:ax
(32-bit) registers, where dx holds the high 16 bits and ax holds the low 16
bits.
 
<b>The Initialization Function</b>
 
You can optionally add an initialization function to a dynamic-link library.
This function, which is called before the actual code for the dynamic-link
library is called, performs user-defined operations. As with
dynamic-link-library functions, you must push existing registers on the
stack before using them in an initialization routine and restore them in
reverse order before exiting from the routine.
 
Be aware that when MS OS/2 starts executing a dynamic-link library, it sets
the CPU registers to known values. For a list of these initial values, see
the topic <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='processes.html'>Multitasking</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>.
 
Initialization functions must be written in assembly language, because the
assembly-language end statement is required to identify the start of the
function. In C, there is no equivalent end statement. You can, however,
write your initialization code in assembly language and the library
functions in C, assemble and compile these files separately, and then
combine them during linking.

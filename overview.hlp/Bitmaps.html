A bitmap is an array of bits that represents an image. Applications can use
bitmaps to store and display scanned images, icons, and symbols, and to
create fill patterns for area primitives and paths. You can display a bitmap
image on a raster output device (a raster is a rectangular matrix of pels or
picture elements on a video display or dot matrix printer). A raster output
device displays an image by setting adjacent pels in its matrix to colors
specified in a corresponding bitmap. An image created in this way is called
a "bitmapped image."
 
Bitmapped images are device dependent. The shape of a device's pels, as well
as its color capabilities, affects the appearance of a bitmapped image. For
example, if the pels on one display measure 0.05 mm by 0.1 mm and the pels
on a second display measure 0.1 mm by 0.3 mm, a circular bitmapped pie chart
that you draw on the first display will appear elliptical on the second. If
the first display supports 16 colors, the second supports 2 colors, and you
created the pie chart using 12 colors, you will lose critical color
information if you draw the chart on the second display.
 
<b>Bitmap Dimensions</b>
 
Each row of pels in a bitmapped image corresponds to a row of bits in a
bitmap. In MS OS/2, bitmap rows are padded so that they end on ULONG
(32-bit) boundaries. Pels in a bitmapped image are numbered beginning in the
lower-left corner, moving to the right across the first row, then proceeding
up, row-by-row, from left to right to the last row. In a bitmapped image,
the first pel is in the lower-left corner; the last pel is in the
upper-right corner. The first byte of the bitmap contains the color
information for the first pel; the last byte contains the color information
for the last pel.
 
When you create a bitmap by using the GpiCreateBitmap function, you specify
the bitmap width and height in terms of pels in the bitmapped image: The
width is the number of pels within a row; the height is the number of rows.
You should store these dimensions in the BITMAPINFO and BITMAPINFOHEADER
structures and pass their addresses to the GpiCreateBitmap function when you
call it.
 
<b>Storing Color Information in Bitmaps</b>
 
Graphics systems use one of two formats for storing color information in
bitmaps. The first format uses multiple color planes. The second format uses
a single plane and a multiple bit count.
 
<b>Color Planes</b>
 
Bitmaps are arranged in color planes. A color plane is an array of bitmap
bits that contain color information. The bitmaps in each of the previous
illustrations used the single-plane format, which is the standard format for
bitmaps in MS OS/2 applications. In this format, adjacent bitmap bits
contain indices into either a special color table of RGB values or actual
<b>RGB</b> structures; all of the color information resides in a single plane.
Although no device drivers for MS OS/2 Presentation Manager currently
support a multi-plane format, this may change. A common multi-plane bitmap
format for a bitmapped image is the 3-plane format in which one plane
corresponds to the red pels, another to the green pels, and a third to the
blue pels. You can determine which color-plane format a device supports by
calling the GpiQueryDeviceBitmapFormats function and examining the first
value in each pair of values that it returns.
 
<b>Bitcounts</b>
 
A bitcount is a value that specifies how many adjacent bitmap bits
correspond to each pel in a bitmapped image. There are four possible
bitcounts:
 
♦  1 bit per pel
♦  4 bits per pel
♦  8 bits per pel
♦  24 bits per pel
 
If a device uses a bitcount of 1, 4, or 8 bits per pel, the bitmap bits
contain index values for a bitmap color table. If the device supports a
bitcount of 1 bit per pel, the color table contains two entries. If the
device supports a bitcount of 4 bits per pel, the color table can contain up
to 16 entries. And if the device supports a bitcount of 8 bits per pel, the
color table can contain up to 256 entries.
 
If the device supports a bitcount of 24 bits per pel, the bitmap bits
contain the bRed, bGreen, and bBlue fields of RGB structures. There is no
color table associated with a bitmap on a device that supports a format of
24 bits per pel (such a device can support over 16 million colors). You can
determine the bitcount format a device supports by calling the
<b>GpiQueryDeviceBitmapFormats</b> function and examining the second value in each
pair of values that it returns. The first pair contains the preferred color
plane and bitmap format. You should create this color table when you call
the GpiCreateBitmap function by loading an array with the appropriate number
of RGB structures and passing the address of this array as the argbColor
field in the BITMAPINFO structure.
 
<b>Creating Bitmaps</b>
 
MS OS/2 requires that you associate a presentation space with a memory
device context before you perform many of the bitmap operations. A memory
device context is a special device context that lets you treat a bitmap in
memory like a device. You can copy color information from another bitmap (or
copy pels on the display) into a bitmap associated with a memory device
context. You create a memory device context with the DevOpenDC function by
passing as the second argument OD_MEMORY and as the last argument a handle
to a compatible device context. For instance, if you are creating a memory
device context that is compatible with a screen device context, you would
pass the handle from the WinOpenWindowDC function as the last argument to
<b>DevOpenDC</b>.
 
When you create a bitmap, you will pass GpiCreateBitmap information about
the bitmap's color plane and bitcount formats, the dimension of the bitmap
in pels, and a description of the bitmap's color table. You will pass this
information in two structures: BITMAPINFO and BITMAPINFOHEADER.
 
<b>Creating and Loading Custom Bitmaps</b>
 
You can create a custom bitmap by setting bits in a hard-coded array and
passing the array to the GpiCreateBitmap function, or by running Icon Editor
and loading the bitmap into your application by calling the GpiLoadBitmap
function. To create a custom hard-coded bitmap, you must perform the
following steps:
 
1  Define in your application's source code an array of bytes that will set
   pels in an image to the appropriate colors.
 
2  Set the fields in the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure to their appropriate
   values.
 
3  Set the fields in the BITMAPINFO structure to their appropriate values.
 
4  Call GpiCreateBitmap, pass it the addresses of the structures and the
   array of bytes you have defined already, and set the flOptions flag to
   TRUE.
 
If you want to use this bitmap as a fill pattern, assign it a local
identifier by calling the GpiSetBitmapId function.
 
To load a custom bitmap that you created by using Icon Editor, you must
perform the following steps:
 
1  Copy the bitmap file to the directory in which you compile your
   applications.
 
2  Create a BITMAP entry in your application's resource file, assigning a
   unique integer identifier to the bitmap.
 
3  In your application's source code, call the GpiLoadBitmap function,
   passing it the integer identifier that you assigned to the bitmap in the
   resource file.
 
You can use GpiLoadBitmap to load any bitmap from a file that conforms to
the MS OS/2 bitmap file format. This means that you could load a bitmap
created by another application, if that application created the correct
bitmap header and stored the bitmap bits correctly.
 
<b>Drawing Bitmapped Images</b>
 
You can draw bitmapped images when your application's drawing mode is
DM_DRAW, DM_RETAIN, or DM_DRAWANDRETAIN. This means that you can draw
bitmapped images on a raster printer or video display, and you can draw them
into segments or metafiles associated with a raster device. Most of the
bitmap drawing operations occur in your application's device space; however,
one drawing operation lets you draw in your application's world space. The
following table describes the functions you can use in each drawing mode:
 
<b>Drawing Modes and Bitmapped Output</b>
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
<b>Drawing mode        Function         Output</b>
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
DM_DRAW             GpiBitBlt        Bitmapped image on a raster display or
                                     printer.
 
DM_DRAW             WinDrawBitmap    Monochrome bitmapped image on a raster
                                     display.
 
DM_DRAW             GpiImage         Special monochrome bitmapped image on a
                                     raster display or printer.
 
DM_DRAW             GpiWCBitBlt      Bitmapped image on a raster display or
                                     printer; or bitmapped image into a
                                     metafile.
 
DM_RETAIN           GpiWCBitBlt      Bitmapped image into a metafile or
                                     segment.
 
DM_DRAWANDRETAIN    GpiWCBitBlt      Bitmapped image on a raster display or
                                     printer and into an associated metafile
                                     or segment.
 
The GpiBitBlt and GpiWCBitBlt functions copy a bitmapped image from a
rectangle in a source presentation space into a rectangle in a target
presentation space. You can use these functions to scale bitmaps (shrink or
expand them) by altering the dimensions of the target and source rectangles.
<b>GpiBitBlt</b> requires that you use device coordinates for the dimensions of
source and target rectangles. GpiWCBitBlt, however, requires device
coordinates for the source rectangle and world coordinates for the target
rectangle. You should use GpiWCBitBlt to draw a bitmap with consistent
dimensions on devices with different aspect ratios. (The aspect ratio is the
ratio of a pel's width to its height.)
 
The WinDrawBitmap function draws a bitmapped image by copying it into a
window linked to a target presentation space. Unlike GpiBitBlt and
<b>GpiWCBitBlt, WinDrawBitmap does n</b>ot require you to select a bitmap into a
presentation space before you draw the corresponding image. You can use this
function to scale bitmaps by specifying DBM_STRETCH as the last argument and
the address of a RECTL structure as the fourth argument. The coordinates in
this structure are always device coordinates.
 
The GpiImage function draws a special bitmapped image. The bitmap bits for a
<b>GpiImage</b> call are not stored like normal bitmap bits──for example, the first
bit in the bitmap contains color information for the pel in the upper-left
(rather than the lower-left) corner of the bitmap; the last bit in the
bitmap contains color information for the pel in the lower-right (rather
than the upper-right) corner of the bitmap.
 
You cannot scale bitmapped images by calling the GpiImage function.
 
You should use the GpiBitBlt or GpiWCBitBlt function to draw bitmaps that
use color formats of 1, 4, 8, or 24 bits per pel. The GpiImage and
<b>WinDrawBitmap</b> functions draw bitmaps using two colors. These two functions
do not use a color table; instead, they use the foreground and background
colors from the IMAGEBUNDLE structure. You can set these colors (and their
corresponding mix modes) by calling the GpiSetAttrs function, or you can
determine the IMAGEBUNDLE colors and mix modes by calling the GpiQueryAttrs
function.
 
You can draw inverted bitmaps by calling the GpiBitBlt or GpiWCBitBlt
function, passing it ROP_NOTSRCCOPY as the raster operation. You can also
draw inverted bitmaps by calling WinDrawBitmap, passing it DBM_INVERT as the
last argument. You can draw halftone bitmaps by calling WinDrawBitmap,
passing it DBM_HALFTONE as the last argument.
 
<b>Copying Images from a Display into a Bitmap</b>
 
You can copy an image from a raster video display into a bitmap by calling
the GpiBitBlt or GpiWCBitBlt function. Before doing so, however, you must
create a memory device context by calling the DevOpenDC function. This
device context lets you treat a bitmap in memory like a device, by copying
color information from pels on the display into the bitmap.
 
Once you create a memory device context, associate it with a presentation
space, and select your bitmap into the presentation space, you can use the
presentation-space handle as the first argument to the GpiBitBlt or
<b>GpiWCBitBlt</b> function. If you will be drawing the image (saved in the memory
device context) on devices with different aspect ratios, you should use the
<b>GpiWCBitBlt</b> function to preserve the original dimensions of the bitmap.
 
<b>Saving Bitmaps in a File</b>
 
You can save a bitmap in a file on a disk by calling the GpiQueryBitmapBits,
<b>DosOpen, DosWrite, and DosClose functions. The Gp</b>iQueryBitmapBits function
copies bitmap bits into a buffer. After you create a file by calling
<b>DosOpen, you can call</b> DosWrite to copy the buffer containing the bitmap bits
into the file. After copying the bits into the file, you close it by calling
<b>DosClose</b>.
 
If you have stored a bitmap on disk and need to use it again in your
application, you can copy the file's contents into a buffer by calling the
<b>DosRead</b> function and then set the bitmap bits by calling the
<b>GpiSetBitmapBits</b> function. (You must associate the bitmap with a memory
device context before trying to set the bits.)
 
If your application creates bitmaps another application might use, it should
create them by using the standard MS OS/2 bitmap file format.

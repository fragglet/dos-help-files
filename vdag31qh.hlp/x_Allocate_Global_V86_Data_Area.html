The _Allocate_Global_V86_Data_Area service allocates a block of memory from
the global V86 data area. The block is for exclusive use by the virtual
device. Virtual devices use this service to allocate memory for
device-specific objects which must be accessible to both the virtual device
and software running in the virtual machine.
 
This service is only available during initialization.
 
<b>Parameter  Description</b>
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
<i>nBytes</i>     Specifies the number of bytes to allocate. This parameter should
           be a multiple of 4096.
 
<i>flags</i>      Specifies the operation flags. This parameter can be a
           combination of the following values:
 
           Value              Meaning
           ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
           GVDAWordAlign      Aligns block on a word boundary. If no
                              alignment value is given, the service aligns
                              the block on a byte boundary.
 
           GVDADWordAlign     Aligns block on a doubleword boundary. If no
                              alignment value is given, the service aligns
                              the block on a byte boundary.
 
           GVDAParaAlign      Aligns block on a paragraph (16-byte)
                              boundary. If no alignment value is given, the
                              service aligns the block on a byte boundary.
 
           GVDAPageAlign      Aligns block on a page (4 kilobyte) boundary.
                              If no alignment value is given, the service
                              aligns the block on a byte boundary.
 
                              The GVDAWordAlign, GVDADWordAlign,
                              GVDAParaAlign, and GVDAPageAlign values are
                              mutually exclusive.
 
           GVDAInstance       Creates an instance data block allowing the
                              virtual device to maintain different values in
                              the block for each virtual machine. If this
                              value is not given, the service creates a
                              global block in which the same data is
                              available to all virtual machines.
 
           GVDAZeroInit       Fills the block with zeros. If this value is
                              not given, the initial content of the block is
                              undefined.
 
           GVDAReclaim        Unmaps any physical pages in the block while
                              mapping the system nul page into the block.
                              The service places unmapped physical pages in
                              the free list. This value only applies if the
                              GVDAPageAlign value is also given. If this
                              value is not given, the service ignores any
                              physical pages it unmaps. It is up to the
                              virtual device to reclaim these pages.
 
                              The GVDAReclaim and GVDAInstance values are
                              mutually exclusive.
 
           GVDAInquire        Returns the size in bytes of the largest block
                              that satisfies the requested alignment but
                              does not require the first V86 page to be
                              moved. The nBytes parameter is not used if
                              this value is specified.
 
                              A virtual device typically uses this value,
                              while processing the Init_Complete message, to
                              allocate portions of the global V86 data area
                              that might otherwise go unused. The
                              GVDAInquire value is only available for
                              Windows version 3.1 or later.
 
           GVDAHighSysCritOK  Informs the service that the virtual device
                              can manage a block that resides in high MS-DOS
                              memory. The service allocates from high MS-DOS
                              memory only if such memory is available (for
                              example, implemented as xMS UMBs) and the
                              virtual device specifies this value. A virtual
                              device can use this value only while
                              processing the Sys_Critical_Init message.
 
                              When first allocated, a block in high MS-DOS
                              memory may not be immediately usable since
                              memory supporting the area may not yet have
                              been mapped. The system maps the memory for
                              the area sometime during the
                              Sys_Critical_Init message, but there is no
                              guarantee as to when.
 
                              The GVDAHighSysCritOK value is only available
                              for Windows version 3.1 or later.
 
           All other values are reserved.
 
<b>Return Value</b>
 
The EAX register contains the ring-0 linear address of the block if the
service is successful. Otherwise, EAX contains zero to indicate an error
such as insufficient memory to satisfy the request.
 
If GVDAInquire is given, EAX contains the size in bytes of the largest block
that satisfies the request, but that does not move the first V86 page. EAX
contains zero if all such requests move the first V86 page.
 
<b>Comments</b>
 
If this service returns an error, the virtual device should consider this a
fatal error and respond accordingly.
 
The size returned when the GVDAInquire value is given may be less than a
reasonable minimum. For instance, if GVDAPageAlign is specified, the return
size may be less than 4096. It is up to the virtual device to check for
this.
 
For blocks allocated with GVDAInstance, this service calls automatically
calls the _AddInstanceItem service.
 
The _Allocate_Global_V86_Data_Area service is not available and must not be
called if the virtual device has allocated a temporary block using the
<b>_Allocate_Temp_V86_Data_Area</b> service. The virtual device must free the block
before it can call the _Allocate_Global_V86_Data_Area service.
 
If GVDAReclaim is not given, the virtual device should reclaim the physical
addresses of any unmapped physical pages and map the pages to other
addresses. A virtual device reclaims the physical addresses by using the
<b>_CopyPageTable</b> service to retrieve the page table entries for the system
virtual machine. The virtual device can then use the _PhysIntoV86 service to
map the physical pages into the V86 address space.

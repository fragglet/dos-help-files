▀ The record is written (logically, not necessarily physically) to the
  disk from memory at the current disk transfer area (DTA) address, spec-
  ified by the most recent call to Int 21H Function 1AH. If the size of
  the record and the location of the buffer are such that a segment over-
  flow or wraparound would occur, the function fails with a return code
  of 02H.
 
▀ The number of bytes of data to be written is specified by the record
  size field (offset 0EH) of the file control block (FCB).
 
▀ The file location of the data that will be written is specified by the
  combination of the current block field (offset 0CH) and current record
  field (offset 20H) of the file control block (FCB). These fields are
  also automatically incremented by this function.
 
▀ [3.0+] If the program is running on a network, the user must have Write
  access rights to the directory containing the file to be written.

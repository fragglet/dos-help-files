▀ If the standard input is not redirected, and the character read is a
  CTRL+C, an Int 23H is executed. If the standard input is redirected, a
  CTRL+C is detected at the console, and BREAK is ON, an Int 23H is exe-
  cuted. To avoid possible interruption by a CTRL+C, use Int 21H Function
  07H instead.
 
▀ To read extended ASCII codes (such as the special function keys F1 to
  F10) on the IBM PC and compatibles, you must call this function twice.
  The first call returns the value 00H to signal the presence of an
  extended code.
 
▀ See also Int 21H Functions 01H, 06H, and 07H, which provide character
  input with various combinations of echo and/or CTRL+C sensing.
 
▀ You can also read the keyboard by issuing a read (Int 21H Function 3FH)
  using the predefined handle for the standard input (0000H), if input
  has not been redirected, or using a handle obtained by opening the
  logical device CON.

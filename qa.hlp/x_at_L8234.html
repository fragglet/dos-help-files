    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

  If the program is returning to COMMAND.COM, control transfers to the
  resident portion, and the transient portion is reloaded if necessary.
  If a batch file is in progress, the next line of the file is fetched
  and interpreted; otherwise, a prompt is issued for the next user
  command.
 
  MS-DOS then takes the following actions:
 
  ■ All memory belonging to the process is released.
 
  ■ File buffers are flushed, and any open handles for files or devices
    owned by the process are closed.
 
  ■ The termination handler vector (Int 22H) is restored from
    PSP:000AH.
 
  ■ The CTRL+C handler vector (Int 23H) is restored from
    PSP:000EH.
 
  ■ The critical-error handler vector (Int 24H) is restored from
    PSP:0012H (MS-DOS versions 2.0 and later).
 
  ■ Control is transferred to the termination handler.
 
▀ Any files that have been written to using FCBs should be closed
  before performing this exit call; otherwise, data may be lost.
 
▀ Other methods of performing a final exit are:
   - Int 21H Function 00H
   - Int 21H Function 31H
   - Int 21H Function 4CH
   - Int 27H
 
▀ [3] If the program is running on a network, it should remove all locks
  it has placed on file regions before terminating.
 
▀ Int 21H Functions 31H and 4CH are the preferred method for termination
  because they allow a return code to be passed to the parent process.

▀ The buffer used by this function has the following format:
  Byte          Contents
  0             maximum number of characters to read, set by program
  1             number of characters actually read (excluding
                  carriage return), set by MS-DOS
  2+            string read from keyboard or standard input,
                  terminated by a carriage return (0DH)
 
▀ If the buffer fills to one fewer than the maximum number of characters
  it can hold, subsequent input is ignored and the bell is sounded until
  a carriage return is detected.
 
▀ This input function is buffered with type-ahead capability, and all of
  the standard keyboard editing commands are active.
 
▀ If the standard input is not redirected, and a CTRL+C is detected at
  the console, an Int 23H is executed. If the standard input is
  redirected, a CTRL+C is detected at the console, and BREAK is ON, an
  Int 23H is executed.
 
▀ See Int 21H Functions 01H, 06H, 07H, and 08H for single-character
  input from the keyboard or standard input device.
 
▀ You can also read strings from the keyboard by performing a read (Int
  21H Function 3FH) using the predefined handle for the standard input
  (0000H), if it has not been redirected, or using a handle obtained by
  opening the logical device CON.

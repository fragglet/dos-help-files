    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

▀ The records are read into memory at the current disk transfer area ad-
  dress, specified by the most recent call to Int 21H Function 1AH. It
  is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that this area is large
  enough for the group of records that will be transferred. If the size
  and location of the buffer are such that a segment overflow or wrapa-
  round would occur, the function fails with a return code of 02H.
 
▀ The file location of the data to be read is determined by the combina-
  tion of the relative-record field (offset 21H) and the record size
  field (offset 0EH) of the FCB. The default record size is 128 bytes.
 
▀ After the disk transfer is performed, the current block (offset 0CH),
  current record (offset 020H), and relative-record (offset 21H) fields
  of the FCB are updated to point to the next record in the file.
 
▀ If a partial record is read at the end of file, the remainder of the
  record is padded with zeros.
 
▀ Compare with Int 21H Function 21H, which transfers only one record per
  function call and does not update the FCB relative-record field.
 
▀ [3.0+] If the program is running on a network, the user must have Read
  access rights to the directory containing the file to be read.

Syntax:  RET [number]
 
  Returns from a procedure by transferring control to an address popped
  from the top of the stack. A constant operand can be given indicating
  the number of additional bytes to release. The constant is normally used
  to adjust the stack for arguments pushed before the procedure was called.
  The size of a return (near or far) is the size of the procedure in
  which the RET is defined with the PROC directive.
 
  RETN can be used to specify a near return; RETF can specify a far
  return. A near return works by popping a word into IP. A far return
  works by popping a word into IP and then popping a word into CS. After
  the return, the number of bytes given in the operand (if any) is added
  to SP.

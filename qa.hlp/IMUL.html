    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

Signed Multiply                                  Flags:  O D I T S Z A P C
Syntax:  IMUL src                                        ═════════════════

  Multiplies an implied destination operand by a specified source operand.
  Both operands are treated as signed numbers. If a single 16-bit operand
  is given, the implied destination is AX and the product goes into
  the DX:AX register pair. If a single 8-bit operand is given, the
  implied destination is AL and the product goes into AX. On the
  80386, if the operand is EAX, the product goes into the EDX:EAX reg-
  ister pair. The carry and overflow flags are set if the product is sign
  extended into DX for 16-bit operands, into AH for 8-bit operands,
  or into EDX for 32-bit operands.
 
  Two additional syntaxes are available on the 80186-80386 processors. In
  the two-operand form, a 16-bit register gives one of the factors and
  serves as the destination for the result; a source constant specifies the
  other factor. In the three-operand form, the first operand is a 16-bit
  register where the result will be stored, the second is a 16-bit register
  or memory operand containing one of the factors, and the third is a con-
  stant representing the other factor. With both variations, the overflow and
  carry flags are set if the result is too large to fit into the 16-bit des-
  tination register. Since the low 16 bits of the product are the same for
  both signed and unsigned multiplication, these syntaxes can be used for
  either signed or unsigned numbers.

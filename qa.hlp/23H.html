  Description:  CTRL+C Handler Address
 
  The machine interrupt vector for Int 23H (memory locations 0000:008CH
  though 0000:008FH) contains the address of the routine which receives
  control when a CTRL+C is detected during any character I/O function and,
  if the Break flag is ON, during most other MS-DOS function calls. The
  address in this vector is also copied into locations 0EH through 11H of
  the program segment prefix (PSP) when a program is loaded but before it
  begins executing, and is restored from the PSP (in case it was modified
  by the application) as part of MS-DOS's termination handling.
 
  This interrupt should never be issued directly.

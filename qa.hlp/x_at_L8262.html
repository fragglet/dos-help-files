▀ This function also opens the file; a subsequent call to Int 21H Func-
  tion 0FH is not required.
 
▀ Since an existing file with the specified name is truncated to zero
  length (i.e., all data in that file is irretrievably lost), this func-
  tion must be used with caution.
 
▀ If this function is called with an extended file control block (FCB),
  the new file may be assigned a special attribute such as hidden or
  system during its creation by setting the appropriate bit in the ex-
  tended FCB's attribute byte.
 
▀ For format of directory time and date, see Int 21H Function 57H.
 
▀ Int 21H Functions 3CH, 5AH, 5BH, and 6CH, which provide full access to
  the hierarchical directory structure, should be used in preference to
  this function.
 
▀ [3.0+] If the program is running on a network, the user must have
  Create rights to the directory that will contain the new file.

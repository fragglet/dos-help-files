▀ This function deletes a file by replacing the first character of its
  filename in the directory with the character e (E5H) and marking the
  file's clusters as "free" in the disk's file allocation table. The
  actual data stored in those clusters is not overwritten.
 
▀ Only one file at a time may be deleted with this function. Unlike the
  FCB-related Delete File function (Int 21H Function 13H), the * and ?
  wildcard characters are not allowed in the file specification.
 
▀ The function fails if:
  - any element of the pathname does not exist.
  - the designated file exists but has the read-only attribute (Int 21H
    Function 43H can be used to examine and modify a file's attribute
    before attempting to delete it).
  - [3.0+] the program is running on a network, and the user running the
    program has insufficient access rights.

    The special ASCII codes for bell (07H), backspace (08H), carriage return
    (0DH), and line feed (0AH) are recognized, and the appropriate action is
    taken. All other characters are written to the display (even if they are
    control characters), and the cursor is moved to the next position.
 
    In video modes that support multiple pages, characters can be written to
    any page, regardless of the page currently being displayed.
 
    Line wrapping and scrolling are provided. If the cursor is at the end of
    a line, it is moved to the beginning of the next line. If the cursor
    reaches the end of the last line on the screen, the screen is scrolled
    up by one line and the cursor is placed at the beginning of a new blank
    line. The attribute for the entire new line is taken from the last char-
    acter that was written on the preceding line.
 
    The default MS-DOS console driver (CON) uses this function to write text
    to the screen. You cannot use this function to specify the attribute of
    a character. One method of writing a character to the screen with a
    specific attribute is to first write an ASCII blank (20H) with the de-
    sired attribute at the current cursor location using Int 10H Function
    09H, then write the actual character with Int 10H Function 0EH. This
    technique, although somewhat clumsy, does not require the program to
    explicitly handle line wrapping and scrolling.
 
    See also Int 10H Function 13H.

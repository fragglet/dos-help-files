▀ The record is read into memory at the current disk transfer area ad-
  dress, specified by the most recent call to Int 21H Function 1AH. It
  is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that this area is large
  enough for any record that will be transferred. If the size and loca-
  tion of the buffer are such that a segment overflow or wraparound would
  occur, the function fails with a return code of 02H.
 
▀ The file location of the data to be read is determined by the combina-
  tion of the relative-record field (offset 21H) and the record size
  field (offset 0EH) of the FCB. The default record size is 128 bytes.
 
▀ The current block field (offset 0CH) and current record field (offset
  20H) are updated to agree with the relative-record field as a side
  effect of the function.
 
▀ The relative-record field of the FCB is not incremented by this func-
  tion; it is the responsibility of the application to update the FCB
  appropriately if it wishes to read successive records. Compare with Int
  21H Function 27H, which can read multiple records with one function call
  and automatically increments the relative-record field.
 
▀ If a partial record is read at end of file, it is padded to the
  requested record length with zeros.
 
▀ [3.0+] If the program is running on a network, the user must have Read
  access rights to the directory containing the file to be read.

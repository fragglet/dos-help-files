▀ If reading from a character device (such as the standard input) in cooked
  mode, at most one line of input will be read (i.e., up to a carriage re-
  turn character or the specified length, whichever comes first).
 
▀ If the carry flag is returned clear but AX = 0, then the file pointer
  was already at end of file when the program requested the read.
 
▀ If the carry flag is returned clear but AX &lt; CX, then a partial record
  was read at end of file or there is an error.
 
▀ [3.0+] If the program is running on a network, the user must have Read
  access rights to the directory and file.

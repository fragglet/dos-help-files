    On fixed disks, the upper 2 bits of the 10-bit cylinder number are
    placed in the upper 2 bits of register CL.
 
    On fixed disks, error code 11H indicates that a read error occurred that
    was corrected by the ECC algorithm; in this event, register AL contains
    the burst length. The data returned is probably good, although there is a
    small chance that the data was not corrected properly. If a multisector
    transfer was requested, the operation was terminated after the sector
    containing the read error.
 
    On floppy disk drives, an error may result from the drive motor being
    off at the time of the request. The ROM BIOS does not automatically wait
    for the drive to come up to speed before attempting the read operation.
    The requesting program should reset the floppy disk system (Int 13H
    Function 00H) and retry the operation three times before assuming that
    the error results from some other cause.

  Description:  Terminate Handler Address
 
  The machine interrupt vector for Int 22H (memory locations 0000:0088H
  through 0000:008BH) contains the address of the routine that receives
  control when the currently executing program terminates via Int 20H,
  Int 27H, or Int 21H Functions 00H, 31H, or 4CH. The address in this
  vector is also copied into offsets 0AH through 0DH of the program seg-
  ment prefix (PSP) when a program is loaded but before it begins execut-
  ing, and is restored from the PSP (in case it was modified by the
  application) as part of MS-DOS's termination handling.
 
  This interrupt should never be issued directly.

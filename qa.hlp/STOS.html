Store String Data                                Flags:  O D I T S Z A P C

Syntax: STOS dest
        STOSB
        STOSW
 
  Stores the value in the accumulator to a string. The string to be filled
  is the destination and must be pointed to by ES:DI (even if an
  operand is given). For each source element loaded, DI is adjusted
  according to the size of the operands and the status of the direction
  flag. DI is increased if the direction flag has been cleared with CLD
  or decreased if the direction flag has been set with STD.
 
  If the STOS form of the instruction is used, an operand must be
  provided to indicate the size of the data elements to be processed.
  No segment override is allowed.  If STOSB (bytes) or STOSW (words) is
  used, the instruction determines the size of the data elements to be
  processed and whether the element will be from AL or AX.  No operand is
  allowed with STOSB or STOSW.
 
  STOS and its variations are often used with the REP prefix.
  Before the repeated instruction is executed, CX should contain the
  number of elements to store.

Syntax: LODS src
        LODSB
        LODSW
 
  Loads a string from memory into the accumulator register. The string to
  be loaded is the source and must be pointed to by DS:SI (even if
  an operand is given). For each source element loaded, SI is adjusted
  according to the size of the operands and the status of the direction
  flag. SI is increased if the direction flag has been cleared with
  CLD or decreased if the direction flag has been set with STD.
 
  If the LODS form of the instruction is used, an operand must be
  provided to indicate the size of the data elements to be processed.  A
  segment override can be given.  If LODSB (bytes) or LODSW (words) is
  used, the instruction determines the size of the data elements to be
  processed and whether the element will be loaded to AL or AX.
  Operands are not allowed with LODSB or LODSW.
 
  LODS and its variations are not normally used with repeat prefixes,
  since there is no reason to repeatedly load memory values to a register.

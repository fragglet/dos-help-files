▀ The record is read into memory at the current disk transfer area (DTA)
  address, specified by the most recent call to Int 21H Function 1AH. If
  the size of the record and the location of the buffer are such that a
  segment overflow or wraparound would occur, the function fails with a
  return code of 02H.
 
▀ The number of bytes of data to be read is specified by the record size
  field (offset 0EH) of the file control block (FCB).
 
▀ The file location of the data that will be read is specified by the com-
  bination of the current block field (offset 0CH) and current record
  field (offset 20H) of the file control block (FCB). These fields are
  also automatically incremented by this function.
 
▀ If a partial record is read at the end of file, it is padded to the
  requested record length with zeros.
 
▀ [3.0+] If the program is running on a network, the user must have Read
  access rights to the directory containing the file to be read.

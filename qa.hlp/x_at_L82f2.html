▀ The function fails if:
  - any element of the specified path does not exist.
  - a file with the identical pathname (i.e., the same filename and exten-
    sion in the same location in the directory structure) already exists.
  - the file is being created in the root directory and the root directory
    is full.
  - [3.0+] the program is running on a network and the user has insuffic-
    ient access rights to the directory that will contain the file.
 
▀ The file is usually given the normal attribute (0) when it is created,
  and is opened for both read and write operations. The attribute can sub-
  sequently be modified with Int 21H Function 43H.
 
▀ See also Int 21H Functions 3CH, 5AH, and 6CH, which provide alternative
  ways of creating files.
 
▀ This function may be used to implement semaphores in a network or multi-
  tasking environment. If the function succeeds, the program has acquired
  the semaphore. To release the semaphore, the program simply deletes the
  file.

  Constant:  b, t
 
  Include:   &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
  Context:   fdopen, fopen, freopen
 
  Synopsis:  Specifies the mode of translation (b or t). The mode
             is included in the string specifying the type of access
             (r, w, a, r+, w+, a+).
 
     The translation modes are described below:
 
     Mode     Meaning
 
     t        Opens in text (translated) mode. In this mode, carriage-
              return──line-feed (CR-LF) combinations are translated
              into single line feeds (LF) on input, and LF characters
              are translated into CR-LF combinations on output. Also,
              CTRL+Z is interpreted as an end-of-file character on
              input. In files opened for reading or reading/writing,
              fopen checks for CTRL+Z at the end of the file and
              removes it, if possible. This is done because using the
              fseek and ftell functions to move within a file ending
              with CTRL+Z may cause fseek to behave improperly near
              the end of the file.
 
              NOTE: The t option is not part of the ANSI standard for
                    open, but is a Microsoft extension and should not
                    be used where ANSI portability is desired.
 
     b        Opens in binary (untranslated) mode. The above
              translations are suppressed.
 
     If t or b is not given in type, the translation mode is defined by
     the default-mode variable.

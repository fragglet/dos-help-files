     The optional F and N prefixes allow the user to override the
     default addressing conventions of the memory model being used.
     The F (indicates far pointer) and N (indicates near pointer)
     prefixes can be used only with %s and %p. Note also that these
     prefixes are not part of the ANSI definition for scanf, but are
     instead Microsoft extensions which should not be used when ANSI
     portability is desired.
 
     The optional prefix l indicates that the long version of the
     following type is expected, and the corresponding argument should
     point to a long or double object. Similarly, the prefix h
     specifies the short version. The l and h modifiers can be used
     with the d, i, n, o, x, and u type characters. The l modifier can
     also be used with the e, f, and g type characters. The l and h
     modifiers are ignored if specified for any other type.
 
     The list below demonstrates the use of N, F, l, and h:
 
     Program Code             Action
 
     scanf( "%Ns", &amp;x );      Read a string into near memory
     scanf( "%Fs", &amp;x );      Read a string into far memory
     scanf( "%Nd", &amp;x );      Read an int into near memory
     scanf( "%Fd", &amp;x );      Read an int into far memory
     scanf( "%Nld", &amp;x );     Read a long int into near memory
     scanf( "%Fld", &amp;x );     Read a long int into far memory
     scanf( "%Nhp", &amp;x );     Read a 16-bit pointer into near memory
     scanf( "%Nlp", &amp;x );     Read a 32-bit pointer into near memory
     scanf( "%Fhp", &amp;x );     Read a 16-bit pointer into far memory
     scanf( "%Flp", &amp;x );     Read a 32-bit pointer into far memory
                                    -♦-

     The _searchenv function searches for the target file in the
     specified domain. The &lt;varname&gt; variable can be any environment
     variable that specifies a list of directory paths, such as PATH,
     LIB, INCLUDE, or other user-defined variables. It is most often
     PATH, which searches for &lt;filename&gt; on all paths specified in the
     PATH variable. The _searchenv function is case sensitive, so
     &lt;varname&gt; should match the case of the environment variable.
 
     The routine first searches for the file in the current working
     directory. If it does not find the file, it looks next through the
     directories specified by the environment variable.
 
     If the target file is found in one of the directories, the newly
     created path is copied into the buffer pointed to by &lt;pathname&gt;.
     You must ensure that there is sufficient space for the constructed
     path name. If &lt;filename&gt; is not found, &lt;pathname&gt; will contain
     an empty null-terminated string.
 
     In OS/2, the list of directory paths specified by &lt;varname&gt; can
     contain double quotation marks, which indicate that the characters
     contained within are not to be interpreted by _searchenv. For
     example, _searchenv ignores a semicolon found within quotes,
     allowing it to be a character in a file name (for OS/2 version
     1.2 file names) and not a path delimiter. The following example
     is a setting recognized by _searchenv as containing three
     directories:
 
          PATH+C:\BIN;"D:\SEMI;COLON\DIN";C:\BINP
 
     Return Value
 
     None.

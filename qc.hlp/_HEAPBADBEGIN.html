  Context:   _heapchk    _bheapchk    _fheapchk    _nheapchk
             _heapset    _bheapset    _fheapset    _nheapset

  Synopsis:  Return value indicating status of the heap.
 
     The meaning of the constants is listed below:
 
     Constant          Meaning
 
     _HEAPBADBEGIN     The initial header information was not found,
                       or it was invalid.
 
     _HEAPBADNODE      A bad node was found, or the heap is damaged.
 
     _HEAPBADPTR       The _pentry field of the entry structure does
                       not contain a valid pointer into the heap
                       (_heapwalk routines only).
 
     _HEAPEMPTY        The heap has not been initialized.
 
     _HEAPEND          The end of the heap was reached successfully
                       (_heapwalk routines only).
 
     _HEAPOK           The heap is consistent (_heapset and _heapchk
                       routines only).
 
                       The heap is OK so far, and the _heapinfo
                       structure contains information about the next
                       entry (_heapwalk routines only).

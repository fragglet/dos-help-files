<b>Creating a startup floppy disk</b>
 
To create a startup floppy disk if you are running DoubleSpace, use either
the SYS command or the FORMAT /S command. Each of these commands creates a
floppy disk that should in most cases be able to start your computer.
However, to make sure, you should also copy the DBLSPACE.BIN file from the
directory that contains your MS-DOS files to the root directory of the
startup floppy disk.
 
For more information about creating a startup floppy disk, see the &lt;<a href='SYS.html'>SYS</a>&gt; or
<i>&lt;<a href='Format.html'>FORMA</i>T</a>&gt; commands.
 
<b>Loading DBLSPACE.BIN into the HMA</b>
 
If you upgraded to MS-DOS 6.22 from MS-DOS 6.2 and you are running
DoubleSpace, you can load a portion of DBLSPACE.BIN into the High Memory
Area (HMA). If you upgraded from MS-DOS 6.0, DBLSPACE.BIN cannot be loaded
into the HMA; in this case, you can save about 14K of memory by converting
to DriveSpace, which can load into the HMA. For more information, see the
following section.
 
<b>Converting from DoubleSpace to DriveSpace</b>
 
If you are running DoubleSpace, you can convert your system to DriveSpace by
uninstalling DoubleSpace and then installing DriveSpace. For more
information, see the DriveSpace section of the README.TXT file, which is
located in the directory that contains your MS-DOS files.

                                  FASTOPEN
 
Starts the Fastopen program, which improves performance on computers with
large directories. Fastopen decreases the amount of time that MS-DOS takes
to open frequently used files. Do not use this command when Windows is
running.
 
Fastopen tracks the location of files on a hard disk and stores the
information in memory for fast access.
 
<b>Syntax</b>
 
    FASTOPEN drive:[[=]n] [drive:[[n][...]] [/X]
 
In your CONFIG.SYS file, use the following syntax:
 
    INSTALL=[[dos-drive:]dos-path]FASTOPEN.EXE drive:[[=]n]
    [drive:[[=]n][...]] [/X]
 
<b>Warning:</b>  To avoid losing data, do not run a defragmentation program such as
          Microsoft Defragmenter while FASTOPEN.EXE is loaded.
 
<b>Parameters</b>
 
[dos-drive:]dos-path
    Specifies the location of FASTOPEN.EXE.
 
drive:
    Specifies a hard disk drive for which you want Fastopen to track the
    opening of files.
 
n
    Specifies the number of files Fastopen can work with at the same time.
    Valid values for n are in the range 10 through 999. The default value is
    48.
 
<b>Switch</b>
 
/X
    Creates the name cache in expanded memory instead of in conventional
    memory. The name cache is an area of memory in which MS-DOS stores
    (caches) the locations and names of the files that you open. This cache
    conforms to version 4.0 of the Lotus/Intel/Microsoft Expanded Memory
    Specification (LIM EMS).

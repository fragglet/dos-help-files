    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

                                FDISK──Notes
 
<b>Using Fdisk to partition a hard disk</b>
 
You can use Fdisk for the following tasks:
 
♦  Creating a primary MS-DOS partition
 
♦  Creating an extended MS-DOS partition
 
♦  Setting a partition to active
 
♦  Deleting a partition
 
♦  Displaying partition data
 
♦  Selecting the next hard disk for partitioning, if a system has multiple
   hard disks
 
<b>CAUTION:</b>  Do not experiment with Fdisk. If you accidently delete a drive or
          partition, you will lose data from your hard disk.
 
<b>Viewing partition information quickly and easily</b>
 
To display an overview of your computer's partition information without
having to start the Fdisk program, use the /STATUS switch. If the /STATUS
switch doesn't provide enough detail about your hard disk, then start the
Fdisk program without the /STATUS switch and choose option 4.
 
<b>Changing the size of a partition</b>
 
To change the size of a partition, you must actually delete the partition
and create a new one with a different size.
 
<b>Maximum partition size</b>
 
The maximum partition size is 2 gigabytes.
 
<b>CAUTION:</b>  Deleting a partition deletes all the data stored on that
          partition.
 
<b>Using Fdisk with SUBST</b>
 
Fdisk does not work on a drive formed by using the SUBST command.
 
<b>Limits of Fdisk</b>
 
Fdisk does not work on a network or an Interlnk drive. Fdisk works only on
hard disks physically installed on your computer.
 
<b>Fdisk and Compressed Drives</b>
 
If your computer includes compressed drives, Fdisk does not display
information about those drives. A compressed disk drive exists on your
physical disk as a hidden, read-only system file called a compressed volume
file (CVF). The CVF is associated with a drive letter; you can then use the
files stored in that CVF. However, to Fdisk, the compressed volume file is
not a separate drive; it is a file just like any other file.

<b>Backing up before uncompressing</b>
 
Before uncompressing your drive, you should back up the files it contains.
To back up your files, use Microsoft Backup for MS-DOS (MSBACKUP) or
Microsoft Backup for Windows.
 
<b>Invalid pathnames after uncompressing</b>
 
When you uncompress a drive, DriveSpace either changes that drive's letter
or the letter of its host drive (depending on how the compressed drive was
originally created.) DriveSpace shows how the drive letters will change when
it uncompresses the drive.
 
Some programs have settings that include explicit pathnames and drive
letters. If a program's settings specify a drive that is no longer valid
after uncompressing, the program will probably display an error message or
be unable to find one of its components or data files. In that case, you
need to correct the drive letter specified by that setting.
 
<b>Disk Space</b>
 
You can uncompress a drive only if the data it contains will fit on the host
drive. If you use the DRVSPACE /UNCOMPRESS command, and DriveSpace indicates
your drive will not have enough free disk space, delete unnecessary files or
move them to another drive.
 
<b>Duplicate Filenames on Compressed and Host Drives</b>
 
If the root directories of the compressed and host drives contain files or
directories with identical names, DriveSpace cannot uncompress the
compressed drive. If this happens, DriveSpace displays an error message, and
creates a DRVSPACE.LOG file that lists the files involved. Use the TYPE
command to view the contents of the DRVSPACE.LOG file. Then, remove or
rename one copy of each file, and then try uncompressing the drive again.
 
<b>Uninstalling DriveSpace</b>
 
When you uncompress the last mounted compressed drive, DriveSpace first
uncompresses the drive, and then removes DRVSPACE.BIN from memory.
(DRVSPACE.BIN is the portion of MS-DOS that provides access to compressed
drives. It uses about 50K of memory.) If there are any unmounted compressed
drives left on your computer, you will not be able to mount them until you
reinstall DriveSpace. (To reinstall DriveSpace, type DRVSPACE at the command
prompt.)

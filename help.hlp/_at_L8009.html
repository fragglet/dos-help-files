                  Starting MS-DOS Help from the Command Line
 
 The HELP command starts MS-DOS Help. You can use it two ways:
 
 ■ To display the table of contents, type HELP at the command prompt, and
   then press ENTER.
 
 ■ To display help about a particular command, type HELP followed by the
   command you want help on. For example, to display help about the COPY
   command, type the following at the command prompt, and then press ENTER:
 
   help copy

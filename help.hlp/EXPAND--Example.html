                              EXPAND──Examples
 
Suppose you accidentally delete the SORT.EXE file from your DOS directory on
drive C. You can copy and expand the compressed file SORT.EX_ from the
MS-DOS 6.22 Setup disks to your hard disk. First, find out which disk
contains SORT.EX_ by opening the PACKING.LST file on Setup Disk 1. Then
insert the appropriate disk into drive A and use the following command to
copy and expand the file:
 
    expand a:\sort.ex_ c:\dos\sort.exe
 
To copy and expand the SORT.EX_ file to the hard disk by letting EXPAND
prompt you, type the following at the command prompt:
 
    expand
 
EXPAND prompts you with the following:
 
    Type the location and name of the compressed file you want to expand.
    (Example: A:\EGA.SY_)
 
    Compressed file:
 
To expand and copy the SORT.EX_ file from the Setup disk in drive A, type
the following:
 
    a:\sort.ex_
 
EXPAND prompts you with the following:
 
    Type the location and/or name you want to give the expanded file.
    (Example: C:\DOS\EGA.SYS)
 
    Expanded file:
 
If your MS-DOS files are in the C:\DOS directory, type the following:
 
    c:\dos\sort.exe

                             SCANDISK──Examples
 
To check and fix the current drive, type the following:
 
    scandisk
 
Suppose that DriveSpace is installed, but is unable to mount your compressed
drive because of problems with the drive. The drive's compressed volume file
is called DRVSPACE.000 and is located in the root directory of drive C. To
repair the volume file, type the following:
 
    scandisk c:\DRVSPACE.000
 
The DriveSpace volume file must be located in the root directory of the
drive.
 
To check both drive C and drive E, type the following:
 
    scandisk c: e:
 
To check all your drives, type the following:
 
    scandisk /all
 
This will check all your hard disk partitions, in addition to all mounted
DriveSpace drives (if DriveSpace is installed).
 
Suppose you created an Undo disk, did not change the contents of the checked
drive since you created the Undo disk, and placed the Undo disk in drive A.
To undo the changes made by ScanDisk,  type the following:
 
    scandisk /undo a:

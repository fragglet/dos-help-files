                            LOADHIGH (LH)──Notes
 
<b>DOS=UMB command required</b>
 
To use the LOADHIGH command, you must include the DOS=UMB command in your
CONFIG.SYS file. For more information about the DOS=UMB command, see the
<i>&lt;<a href='Dos.html'>DOS</a>&gt; </i>command.
 
<b>Using MemMaker to optimize the upper memory area automatically</b>
 
The MemMaker program, included with MS-DOS, automatically optimizes your
system's memory. MemMaker surveys the upper memory area, analyzes the memory
use of your drivers and programs, and determines which drivers and programs
fit best into the available UMBs. MemMaker then adds the LOADHIGH command to
selected lines in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and adds /L and /S switches as
necessary. For more information about using MemMaker to optimize your
computer's memory, see the chapter "Making More Memory Available" in the
MS-DOS User's Guide.
 
<b>Upper-memory-area manager must be installed</b>
 
Before you can load a program into the upper memory area, you must install
an upper-memory-area manager. MS-DOS provides EMM386.EXE, which manages the
upper memory area for computers with an 80386 or higher processor. To
install EMM386, you add a DEVICE command to your CONFIG.SYS file. (The
DEVICE command for the HIMEM.SYS extended-memory manager must precede the
DEVICE command for EMM386.)
 
<b>How LOADHIGH works</b>
 
When you use the LOADHIGH command to load a program, MS-DOS attempts to load
it into the upper memory area. If there is insufficient space in the upper
memory area, MS-DOS loads the program into conventional memory. To determine
which UMB(s) the program is using, use the MEM /M command and specify the
program name as an argument.
 
<b>Using LOADHIGH in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file</b>
 
The most convenient way to use the LOADHIGH command is to include it in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file. (If you use the MemMaker program, it automatically adds
any necessary LOADHIGH commands to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.)

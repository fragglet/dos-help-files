                              DISKCOMP──Notes
 
<b>Invalid drive for DISKCOMP</b>
 
The DISKCOMP command works only with floppy disks. You cannot use DISKCOMP
with a hard disk. If you specify a hard disk drive for drive1 or drive2,
DISKCOMP displays the following error message:
 
    Invalid drive specification
    Specified drive does not exist
    or is non-removable
 
<b>DISKCOMP messages</b>
 
If all tracks on the two disks being compared are the same, DISKCOMP
displays the following message:
 
    Compare OK
 
If the tracks are not the same, DISKCOMP displays a message similar to the
following:
 
    Compare error on
    side 1, track 2
 
When DISKCOMP completes the comparison, it displays the following message:
 
    Compare another diskette (Y/N)?
 
If you press Y, DISKCOMP prompts you to insert disks for the next
comparison. If you press N, DISKCOMP stops the comparison.
 
DISKCOMP ignores a disk's volume number when it makes the comparison.
 
<b>Omitting drive parameters</b>
 
If you omit the drive2 parameter, DISKCOMP uses the current drive for
drive2. If you omit both drive parameters, DISKCOMP uses the current drive
for both. If the current drive is the same as drive1, DISKCOMP prompts you
to swap disks as necessary.
 
<b>Using one drive for the comparison</b>
 
If you specify the same floppy disk drive for drive1 and drive2, DISKCOMP
does a comparison by using one drive and prompts you to insert the disks as
necessary. You might have to swap the disks more than once, depending on the
capacity of the disks and the amount of available memory.
 
<b>Comparing different types of disks</b>
 
DISKCOMP cannot compare a single-sided disk with a double-sided disk or a
high-density disk with a double-density disk. If the disk in drive1 is not
of the same type as the disk in drive2, DISKCOMP displays the following
message:
 
    Drive types or diskette types not compatible
 
<b>Using DISKCOMP with networks and redirected drives</b>
 
DISKCOMP does not work on a network drive or on a drive created or affected
by a SUBST command. If you attempt to use DISKCOMP with a network drive or a
drive created by the SUBST command, DISKCOMP displays an error message.
 
<b>Comparing an original disk with a copy</b>
 
When you use DISKCOMP with a disk that you made with the COPY command,
DISKCOMP may display a message similar to the following:
 
    Compare error on
    side 0, track 0
 
This type of error can occur even if the files on the disks are identical.
Although the COPY command duplicates information, it doesn't necessarily
place it in the same location on the destination disk. For more information
about comparing individual files on two disks, see the &lt;<a href='Fc.html'>FC</a>&gt; command.
 
<b>DISKCOMP exit codes</b>
 
The following list shows each exit code and gives a brief description of its
meaning:
 
0
    The disks are the same.
 
1
    Differences were found.
 
2
    The user pressed CTRL+C to stop the process.
 
3
    A critical error occurred.
 
4
    An initialization error occurred.
 
You can use the ERRORLEVEL parameter on the IF command line in a batch
program to process exit codes returned by DISKCOMP. For an example of a
batch program that processes exit codes, see the &lt;<a href='Choice.html'>CHOICE</a>&gt; command.

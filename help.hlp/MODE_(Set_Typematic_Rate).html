                         MODE (Set Typematic Rate)
 
Sets the keyboard typematic rate, the rate at which MS-DOS repeats a
character when you hold down the key for that character.
 
The typematic rate has two components, the rate and the delay. Some
keyboards do not recognize this command.
 
<b>Syntax</b>
 
    MODE CON[:] [RATE=r DELAY=d]
 
<b>Parameters</b>
 
CON[:]
    Refers to the keyboard.
 
RATE=r
    Specifies the rate at which a character is repeated on the screen when
    you hold down a key. Valid values are in the range 1 through 32. These
    values are equal to approximately 2 to 30 characters per second,
    respectively. The default value is 20 for IBM AT-compatible keyboards
    and 21 for IBM PS/2-compatible keyboards. If you set the rate, you must
    also set the delay. for IBM PS/2-compatible keyboards. If you set the
    rate, you must also set the delay.
 
DELAY=d
    Specifies the amount of time that must elapse──after you press and hold
    down a key──before MS-DOS starts to repeat the character. Valid values
    for d are 1, 2, 3, and 4 (representing 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1 second,
    respectively). The default value is 2. If you set the delay, you must
    also set the rate.

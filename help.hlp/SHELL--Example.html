                              SHELL──Examples
 
Suppose the file NEWSHELL.COM is in a directory named BIN on your startup
drive, and suppose you want to use NEWSHELL.COM as your command interpreter.
To do this, add the following command to your CONFIG.SYS file:
 
    shell=\bin\newshell.com
 
Suppose you add the line SHELL=NEWCMDP.COM to your CONFIG.SYS file, and
suppose the NEWCMDP.COM command interpreter accepts the switches /C, /P, and
/E. You can now use any of these switches on the SHELL command line. Thus,
the following command would be valid:
 
    shell=newcmdp.com /c /p /e
 
The SHELL command is the preferred method of using COMMAND to increase the
size of the environment. To increase the environment size to 512 bytes, add
the following command to your CONFIG.SYS file:
 
    shell=command.com /e:512 /p
 
To start an MS-DOS command interpreter located in the directory OLD on drive
C, add the following command to your CONFIG.SYS file:
 
    shell=c:\old\command.com c:\old /e:256 /p
 
For information about COMMAND.COM switches, see the &lt;<a href='Command.html'>COMMAND</a>&gt; command.

<b>Compressing Floppy Disks</b>
 
You can use DriveSpace to increase the storage capacity of floppy disks in
addition to hard disks. After compressing a floppy disk, you can use it to
store data or to transfer data from one computer to another.
 
Compressing a floppy disk is similar to compressing an existing hard disk
drive. You can compress a floppy disk that is completely empty or one that
contains a few files. (Make sure the floppy disk is formatted and has at
least 1.1 MB of free space. DriveSpace cannot compress a floppy disk that is
full. DriveSpace also cannot compress 360K floppy disks.)
 
<b>Using Compressed Floppy Disks</b>
 
In general, you use a compressed floppy disk just as you would a normal
floppy disk. The main difference is that, to use a compressed floppy disk to
transfer data from one computer to another, both computers must be running
DriveSpace.
 
<b>Mounting Compressed Floppy Disks</b>
 
By default, DriveSpace automatically mounts a compressed floppy disk when
you try to use that disk. However, if you disable DriveSpace's Automount
feature in order to save memory, you must mount each compressed floppy disk
yourself, before you can use it.
 
If you have turned off Automount, when you first compress a floppy disk,
DriveSpace mounts it for you. However, if you change floppy disks or restart
your computer, you will have to remount the floppy disk before you can use
it again.
 
To mount a floppy disk, use the &lt;<a href='DRVSPACE__sl_MOUNT.html'>DRVSPACE /MOUNT</a>&gt; command.
 
To enable or disable DriveSpace's Automount feature, use the
<i>&lt;<a href='AUTOMOUNTING.html'>DRVSP</i>ACE /AUTOMOUNT</a>&gt; command.

                                  RESTORE
 
Restores files that were backed up by using any version of BACKUP from
MS-DOS versions 2.0 through 5.0. If you are restoring files that were backed
up using the MSBACKUP program in MS-DOS 6 or later, use that version of the
<i>&lt;<a href='backup.html'>MSBAC</i>KUP</a>&gt; program to restore those files.
 
You can restore files from similar or dissimilar disk types.

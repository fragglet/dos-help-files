     Format specifications are introduced by the percent sign (%) and
     have the following form:
 
          % [*] [width] [ { F | N } ] [ { h | l } ] type
 
     Each field of the format specification is a single character or a
     number signifying a particular format option. The &lt;type&gt;
     character, which appears after the last optional format field,
     determines whether the input field is interpreted as a character,
     a string, or a number. The simplest format specification contains
     only the percent sign and a type character (for example, %s).
     See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='_at_L83b6.html'>Prefixes</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span> <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='_at_L83b7.html'>Type</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
     If a percent sign (%) is followed by a character that has no
     meaning as a format-control character, that character is treated
     as ordinary. For example, to specify that a percent-sign character
     is to be input, use %%.
 
     An asterisk (*) following the percent sign suppresses assignment
     of the next input field, which is interpreted as a field of the
     specified type. The field is scanned but not stored.
 
     The width is a positive decimal integer controlling the maximum
     number of characters to be read from stdin. No more than &lt;width&gt;
     characters are converted and stored at the corresponding argument.
     Fewer than &lt;width&gt; characters may be read if a white-space
     character (space, tab, or newline) or a character that cannot
     be converted according to the given format occurs before &lt;width&gt;
     is reached.

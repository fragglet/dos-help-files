  Keyword:  delete
 
  Syntax:   [::] delete pointer
            [::] delete [] pointer
 
  Summary:  Deallocates a block of memory. The argument &lt;pointer&gt;
            must point to a block of memory previously allocated by the
            new operator. If &lt;pointer&gt; points to an array, place empty
            brackets before &lt;pointer&gt;.
 
  See also: new, __near, __far, __huge, __based

     The run-time library provides four versions of the delete
     operator to deallocate pointers that are near, far, huge, or
     based. The version that is selected depends on the addressing mode
     of &lt;pointer&gt; (for example, if it's a near pointer, the near delete
     operator is called).
 
     If the addressing mode of &lt;pointer&gt; doesn't reflect the version of
     the new operator that was used to allocate the memory, the
     incorrect version of the delete operator is called. For example:
 
         Node __far *fpN;
         fpN = new Node __near;  // convert near to far
         delete fpn;             // far delete invoked for near object
 
     Here, the compiler chooses the inappropriate delete operator
     for the pointer, which results in a run-time error. To prevent
     this problem, explicitly cast the pointer to the desired
     addressing mode:
 
         delete (Node __near *)fpN;
                                    -♦-

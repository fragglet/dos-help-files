     Pointers based on a fixed segment are restricted to accessing one
     segment of memory. By making assignments to the based pointer, you
     change only the offset portion of the address.
 
     Pointers Based on a Named Segment
 
     Form of &lt;base&gt;:
 
          __segname(&lt;string literal&gt;)
 
     The &lt;string literal&gt; can be the name of one of four predefined
     segments ("_CODE", "_CONST", "_DATA" or "_STACK"), or it can be
     the name of a new segment you define. A based pointer declared
     this way can address locations only in the specified segment.
 
     For example:
          // pointer into current code segment
          char __based(__segname("_CODE")) *bp;
 
     Pointers Based on the Segment of a Variable
 
     Form of &lt;base&gt;:
 
          (__segment)&amp;&lt;var&gt;
 
     A based pointer declared this way uses the segment of the address
     of &lt;var&gt; as its base. It can address locations only in the same
     segment as &lt;var&gt;.
 
     For example:
 
          int i;
          // pointer using i's segment as its base
          char __based((__segment)&amp;i) *bp;
                                    -♦-

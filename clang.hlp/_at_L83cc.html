     The strcmp, _stricmp, strncmp, and _strnicmp functions operate on
     null-terminated strings. The &lt;string&gt; arguments to these functions
     are expected to contain a null character (\0) marking the end of
     the string.
 
     The _stricmp function is a case-insensitive version of strcmp, and
     the _strnicmp function is a case-insensitive version of strncmp.
     The _strcmpi function is an obsolete synonym for _stricmp. It is
     supported for compatibility. These three functions actually
     perform a lowercase comparison of their &lt;string&gt; arguments.
 
     The strcmp, _strcmpi, and _stricmp functions compare &lt;string1&gt; and
     &lt;string2&gt; and return a value indicating their relationship, as
     follows:
 
     Value     Meaning
 
     &lt; 0       &lt;string1&gt; is less than &lt;string2&gt;
     = 0       &lt;string1&gt; is identical to &lt;string2&gt;
     &gt; 0       &lt;string1&gt; is greater than &lt;string2&gt;
 
     Note that for _stricmp, _strnicmp, and _strcmpi, two strings
     containing characters located between 'Z' and 'a' in the ASCII
     table ('[', '\', ']', '^', '_', and '`') compare differently
     depending on their case. For example, the two strings, "ABCDE"
     and "ABCD^" compare one way if the comparison is lowercase
     ("abcde" &gt; "abcd^") and the other way if it is uppercase
     ("ABCDE" &lt; "ABCD^").
 
     The strncmp and _strnicmp functions operate on, at most, the first
     &lt;count&gt; characters of null-terminated strings. The strncmp and
     _strnicmp functions compare, at most, the first &lt;count&gt; characters
     of &lt;string1&gt; and &lt;string2&gt; and return a value indicating the
     relationship between the substrings, as listed below:
 
     Value     Meaning
 
     &lt; 0       &lt;substring1&gt; is less than &lt;substring2&gt;
     = 0       &lt;substring1&gt; is identical to &lt;substring2&gt;
     &gt; 0       &lt;substring1&gt; is greater than &lt;substring2&gt;
 
     The _f... forms of these functions are model-independent (large-
     model) forms that use far pointer forms of the string arguments
     and return values. These model-independent functions can be called
     from any memory model. Note that there is not a model-independent
     version of the obsolete _strcmpi function. You should use the
     _fstricmp function in its place.
 
     Return Value
 
     The return values for these functions are described above.

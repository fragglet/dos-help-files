    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

     The _flushall function writes the unwritten contents of all
     buffers associated with open output streams either to the
     operating system or to disk.
 
     If a file was opened with the "n" flag, the buffer associated with
     the file is written to the operating system's buffers. If a file
     was opened with the "c" flag, the buffer associated with the file
     is written directly to disk. Without either flag, the buffer is
     written to the operating system.
 
     All buffers associated with open input streams are cleared of
     their current contents. The next read operation (if there is one)
     then reads new data from the input files into the buffers.
 
     Buffers are automatically flushed to the operating system when
     they are full, when streams are closed, or when a program
     terminates normally without closing streams.
 
     All streams remain open after the call to _flushall.
 
     Return Value
 
     The _flushall function returns the number of open streams (input
     and output). There is no error return.

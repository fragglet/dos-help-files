  Summary:   Constants assigned to errno in the event of various error
             conditions.
 
     The include file ERRNO.H contains the definitions of the errno
     values. However, not all of the definitions given in ERRNO.H are
     used in DOS. Some of the values in ERRNO.H are present to
     maintain compatibility with the UNIX (and XENIX) operating
     system.
 
     The errno values in DOS are a subset of the values for errno in
     XENIX systems. Thus, the errno value is not necessarily the same
     as the actual error code returned by a DOS system call. To access
     the actual DOS error code, use the _doserrno variable, which
     contains this value.
 
     The following errno values are supported:
 
     Constant      Meaning
 
     ECHILD        No child processes.
 
     EAGAIN        No more processes.
 
                   An attempt to create a new process failed, because
                   there are no more process slots, or there is not
                   enough memory, or the maximum nesting level has been
                   reached.
 
     E2BIG         Arg list too long.
 
                   Under DOS: The argument list exceeds 128 bytes, or
                   the space required for the environment information
                   exceeds 32K.
 
     EACCES        Permission denied.
 
                   The file's permission setting does not allow the
                   specified access. This error signifies that an
                   attempt was made to access a file (or, in some
                   cases, a directory) in a way that is incompatible
                   with the file's attributes.
 
                   For example, the error can occur when an attempt is
                   made to read from a file that is not open, to open
                   an existing read-only file for writing, or to open a
                   directory instead of a file. Under MS-DOS versions
                   3.0 and later, EACCES may also indicate a locking or
                   sharing violation.
 
                   The error can also occur in an attempt to rename a
                   file or directory or to remove an existing
                   directory.
 
     EBADF         Bad file number.
 
                   The specified file handle is not a valid file-handle
                   value or does not refer to an open file; or an
                   attempt was made to write to a file or device opened
                   for read-only access (or vice versa).
 
     EDEADLOCK     Resource deadlock would occur.
 
                   The file cannot be locked after 10 attempts (MS-DOS
                   versions 3.0 and later only).
 
     EDOM          Math argument.
 
                   The argument to a math function is not in the domain
                   of the function.
 
     EEXIST        File exists.
 
                   An attempt has been made to create a file that
                   already exists. For example, the _O_CREAT and
                   _O_EXCL flags are specified in an open call, but
                   the named file already exists.
 
     EINVAL        Invalid argument.
 
                   An invalid value was given for one of the arguments
                   to a function. For example, the value given for the
                   origin when positioning a file pointer (by means of
                   a call to fseek) is before the beginning of the file.
 
     EMFILE        Too many open files.
 
                   No more file handles are available, so no more files
                   can be opened.
 
     ENOENT        No such file or directory.
 
                   The specified file or directory does not exist or
                   cannot be found. This message can occur whenever a
                   specified file does not exist or a component of a
                   path name does not specify an existing directory.
 
     ENOEXEC       Exec format error.
 
                   An attempt was made to execute a file that is not
                   executable or that has an invalid executable-file
                   format.
 
     ENOMEM        Not enough core.
 
                   Not enough memory is available for the attempted
                   operator. For example, this message can occur when
                   insufficient memory is available to execute a child
                   process, or when the allocation request in a
                   _getcwd call cannot be satisfied.
 
     ENOSPC        No space left on device.
 
                   No more space for writing is available on the device
                   (for example, when the disk is full).
 
     ERANGE        Result too large.
 
                   An argument to a math function is too large,
                   resulting in partial or total loss of significance
                   in the result. This error can also occur in other
                   functions when an argument is larger than expected
                   (for example, when the path-name argument to the
                   _getcwd function is longer than expected).
 
     EXDEV         Cross-device link.
 
                   An attempt was made to move a file to a different
                   device (using the rename function).

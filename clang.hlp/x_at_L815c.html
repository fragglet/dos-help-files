     The functions in the _heapset family help debug heap-related
     problems by showing free memory locations or nodes that were
     unintentionally overwritten.
 
     The _heapset functions first check for minimal consistency on the
     heap in a manner identical to that of the _heapchk functions. In
     addition, the _heapset functions set each byte of the heap's free
     entries to the fill value. This known value shows which memory
     locations of the heap contain free nodes and where data was
     unintentionally written to freed memory.
 
     The various _heapset functions check and fill these heaps:
 
     Function      Heap Filled
 
     _heapset      Depends on data model of program
     _bheapset     Based heap specified by &lt;seg&gt; value; _NULLSEG
                   specifies all based heaps
     _fheapset     Far heap (outside default data segment)
     _nheapset     Near heap (inside default data segment)
 
     In large data models (compact-, large-, and huge-model programs),
     _heapset maps to _fheapset. In small data models (tiny-, small-,
     and medium-model programs), _heapset maps to _nheapset.
 
     For _heapset, if the &lt;seg&gt; value is _NULLSEG, all based heap
     segments are checked; otherwise, only the specified one is
     checked.
 
     Return Value
 
     All four routines return an int type whose value is one of the
     following manifest constants (defined in MALLOC.H):
 
     _HEAPOK     _HEAPEMPTY     _HEAPBADBEGIN     _HEAPBADNODE

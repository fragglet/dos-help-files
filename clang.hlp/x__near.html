  Keyword:   __near
 
  Syntax:    type __near declarator
             class __near class-name
             class __near class-name func()
             type member-func() __near
 
  Summary:   Specifies that a data object resides in the default
             data segment. Specifies that a function can be called
             only by functions in the same code segment. Functions and
             data are referenced with 16-bit addresses, and pointers
             declared as __near are 16-bit values.

     The __near keyword can be used to modify data objects, pointers,
     functions, classes, the this pointer of member functions, and the
     addressing mode of objects returned by functions.
 
     If the /Zc compiler switch is used, both near and _near are
     synonyms for __near. If /Za is used, only __near is accepted.
 
     NOTE: Do not use __near in a 32-bit program.
 
     Data Objects or Pointers
 
     A near data object resides in the default data segment.
 
     A near pointer is a 16-bit value and can address locations
     within the default segment, but not locations outside of it.
 
     For example:
 
          char __near a;               // Char in default data segment
          char __near *np;             // Near pointer
 
     The Calling Convention of Functions
 
     A near function can be called only by other functions in the
     same code segment. A pointer to a near function is a 16-bit value.
 
     For example:
 
          char __near redraw();
 
     You can control the placement of functions within segments.

     Classes
 
     Objects of a near class reside in the default data segment unless
     an overriding keyword appears in the individual declaration.
     Structure or union types can also be declared as __near.
 
     For example:
 
          class __near Node
          {
             // ...
          };
 
          Node my_node;              // Near by default
          Node __far your_node;      // Explicitly declared __far
 
     Member Functions
 
     You can overload a member function to operate on near objects
     if objects of the class are not near by default. Within the
     function, the this pointer is a near pointer.
 
     For example:
 
          class Node
          {
          public:
             void print() __near;      // Called for near objects
             void print();             // Called for default objects
          private:
             // ...
          };
 
     The Addressing Mode of Return Objects
 
     You can specify that a function return a near object. This is
     useful if you call a member function for the temporary object
     returned by the function.
 
     For example:
 
          class __near Node make_node(); // Function returns a near Node
 
          make_node().print();     // Call near print() for temporary
                                   //    object
                                    -♦-

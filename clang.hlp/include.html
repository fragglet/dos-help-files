  Directive:  #include
 
  Syntax:     #include "path-spec"
              #include &lt;path-spec&gt;
 
  Summary:    Inserts the contents of the file specified by path-spec
              into the current file. If the path-spec contains the
              complete drive and path specification, that file is
              included without searching any directories. If path-spec
              is enclosed in double quotation marks, the directory of
              the file containing the #include directive is searched.
 
              If the current file is also an include file, the
              directory of the parent file is searched. This search
              continues recursively through all the nested include
              files until the original source file's directory is
              searched.
 
              If the file is still not found or if the path-spec is
              enclosed in angle brackets, the next directories searched
              are the ones specified using the /I command-line option.
              After those have been searched, the compiler searches the
              directories specified in the INCLUDE environment
              variable.

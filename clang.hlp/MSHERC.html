     In _HERCMONO mode, only monochrome (two-color) text and graphics
     are supported. The screen resolution is 720 x 348 pixels. The text
     dimensions are 80 columns by 25 rows, with a 9 x 14 character box.
     The bottom two scan lines of the twenty-fifth row are not visible.
 
     You must install the Hercules driver MSHERC.COM before running your
     program. Type MSHERC to load the driver. This can be automated by
     adding a line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
 
     If you have both a Hercules monochrome card and a color video card,
     you should install MSHERC.COM with the /H (/HALF) option. The /H
     option causes the driver to use one instead of two graphics pages.
     This prevents the two video cards from attempting to use the same
     memory. You do not need to use the /H option if you have only a
     Hercules card. See your Hercules hardware manuals for more details
     on compatibility.
 
     To use a mouse, you must follow special instructions for Hercules
     cards in the book Microsoft Mouse Programmer's Reference Guide.
     (This book is sold separately; it is not supplied with either
     Microsoft C/C++ or the mouse package.)

     The _wyield function yields control to Windows in order to give
     processor time to other Windows applications. This routine is
     used only in QuickWin programs; it is not part of the Windows
     API. For full details about QuickWin, see Chapter 8 of the
     Programming Techniques manual.
 
     A Windows application must service its message queue periodically
     to ensure smooth appearance and performance. Well-behaved
     QuickWin applications yield time to other applications and allow
     the user to switch tasks without having to wait for the QuickWin
     program to complete lengthy processing.
 
     The compiler attempts to issue "yield for queue servicing" calls
     at appropriate times. But in some cases a program requires
     additional yield calls, particularly during lengthy processing
     loops. If Windows appears sluggish when running a QuickWin
     program, insert _wyield calls into the program to improve
     Windows' responsiveness.
 
     Note that when an application is servicing the message queue
     (yielding) it can be told to stop so the user can work with
     another running Windows application.
 
     Return Value
 
     None.

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

  Keyword:  operator
 
  Syntax:   type operator operator-symbol ( parameter-list )
 
  Summary:  Declares a function specifying what &lt;operator-symbol&gt;
            means when applied to instances of a class. This gives the
            operator more than one meaning, or "overloads" it. The
            compiler distinguishes between the different meanings of
            an operator by examining the types of its operands.

     Rules of Operator Overloading
 
     ■ You can overload the following operators:
 
          +     -     *     /     %     ^     &amp;     |     ~
          !     =     &lt;     &gt;     +=    -=    *=    /=    %=
          ^=    &amp;=    |=    &lt;&lt;    &gt;&gt;    &lt;&lt;=   &gt;&gt;=   ==    !=
          &lt;=    &gt;=    &amp;&amp;    ||    ++    --    ,     -&gt;    -&gt;*
          ()    []    new   delete
 
     ■ If an operator can be used as either a unary or a binary
       operator, you can overload each use separately.
 
     ■ You can overload an operator using either a nonstatic member
       function or a global function that's a friend of a class.
       A global function must have at least one parameter that is of
       class type or a reference to class type.
 
     ■ If a unary operator is overloaded using a member function, it
       takes no arguments. If it is overloaded using a global function,
       it takes one argument.
 
     ■ If a binary operator is overloaded using a member function, it
       takes one argument. If it is overloaded using a global function,
       it takes two arguments.
 
     Restrictions on Operator Overloading
 
     ■ You cannot define new operators, such as **.
 
     ■ You cannot change the precedence or grouping of an operator,
       nor can you change the numbers of operands it accepts.
 
     ■ You cannot redefine the meaning of an operator when applied to
       built-in data types.
 
     ■ Overloaded operators cannot take default arguments.
 
     ■ You cannot overload any preprocessor symbol, nor can you
       overload the following operators:
 
          .     .*    ::    ?:    :&gt;
 
     ■ The assignment operator has some additional restrictions. It
       can be overloaded only as a nonstatic member function, not as a
       friend function. It is the only operator that cannot be
       inherited; a derived class cannot use a base class's assignment
       operator.
 
     Example
 
     The following stack class overloads the += operator to push a
     value onto a stack and return the new stack.
 
          class Complex
          {
          public:
              Complex( float re, float im );
              Complex operator+( Complex &amp;other );
              friend Complex operator+( int first, Complex &amp;second );
          private:
              float real, imag;
          };
 
          // Operator overloaded using a member function
          Complex Complex::operator+( Complex &amp;other )
          {
              return Complex( real + other.re, imag + other.im );
          };
 
          // Operator overloaded using a friend function
          Complex operator+( int first, Complex &amp;second )
          {
              return Complex( first + second.re, second.im );
          }
                                    -♦-

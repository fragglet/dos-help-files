     The setvbuf function allows the program to control both buffering
     and buffer size for &lt;stream&gt;. The &lt;stream&gt; must refer to an open
     file that has not been read from or written to since it was
     opened. The array pointed to by &lt;buffer&gt; is used as the buffer,
     unless it is NULL, and an automatically allocated buffer &lt;size&gt;
     bytes long is used.
 
     The &lt;mode&gt; argument specifies the type of buffer for setvbuf; it
     must be one of the following manifest constants (defined in
     stdio.h):
 
     _IOFBF     _IOLBF     _IONBF
 
     If &lt;mode&gt; is _IOFBF or _IOLBF, then &lt;size&gt; is used as the size of
     the buffer. If &lt;mode&gt; is _IONBF, the stream is unbuffered and
     &lt;size&gt; and &lt;buffer&gt; are ignored.  The legal values for &lt;size&gt; are
     greater than 0 and less than 32,768.
 
     Return Value
 
     The return value for setvbuf is 0 if successful, and a nonzero
     value if an illegal type or buffer size is specified. There is
     no return value for setbuf.

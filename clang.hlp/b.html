  Constant:  "b", "t"
 
  Include:   &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
  Context:   _fdopen, fopen, freopen, _fwopen
 
  Summary:   Specifies the mode of translation ("b" or "t"). The
             mode is included in the string specifying the type of
             access ("r", "w", "a", "r+", "w+", "a+").
 
     The translation modes are described below:
 
     Mode     Meaning
 
     "t"      Opens in text (translated) mode. In this mode, carriage-
              return─linefeed (CR-LF) combinations are translated
              into single linefeeds (LF) on input, and LF characters
              are translated into CR-LF combinations on output. Also,
              CTRL+Z is interpreted as an end-of-file character on
              input.
 
              In files opened for reading or reading/writing, fopen
              checks for CTRL+Z at the end of the file and removes it,
              if possible. This is done because using the fseek and
              ftell functions to move within a file ending with CTRL+Z
              may cause fseek to behave improperly near the end of the
              file.
 
              NOTE: The "t" option is not part of the ANSI standard for
                    fopen and freopen, but is a Microsoft extension and
                    should not be used where ANSI portability is
                    desired.
 
     "b"      Opens in binary (untranslated) mode. The above
              translations are suppressed.
 
     If "t" or "b" is not given in type, the translation mode is
     defined by the default-mode variable.
 
     See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='x_at_L834e.html'>BINMODE.OBJ</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span> for a discussion of binary and text modes.

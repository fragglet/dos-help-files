     The _pie functions draw a pie-shaped wedge by drawing an
     elliptical arc whose center and two endpoints are joined by
     lines. The following list summarizes the arguments to the _pie
     functions:
 
     Argument       Description
 
     &lt;control&gt;      Either the _GFILLINTERIOR or the _GBORDER manifest
                    constant
 
     &lt;x1&gt;, &lt;y1&gt;     Upper-left corner of bounding rectangle
 
     &lt;x2&gt;, &lt;y2&gt;     Lower-right corner of bounding rectangle
 
     &lt;x3&gt;, &lt;y3&gt;     Second point of start vector (center of bounding
                    rectangle is first point)
 
     &lt;x4&gt;, &lt;y4&gt;     Second point of end vector (center of bounding
                    rectangle is first point)
 
     &lt;pwxy1&gt;        Upper-left corner of bounding rectangle
 
     &lt;pwxy2&gt;        Lower-right corner of bounding rectangle
 
     &lt;pwxy3&gt;        Second point of start vector (center of bounding
                    rectangle is first point)
 
     &lt;pwxy4&gt;        Second point of end vector (center of bounding
                    rectangle is first point)
 
     The &lt;control&gt; option given by _GFILLINTERIOR is equivalent to a
     subsequent call to the _floodfill function using the approximate
     center of the pie as the starting point and the current color
     (set by _setcolor) as the boundary color. Use the _getarcinfo
     function to find the exact starting point.
 
     The center of the pie is the center of the bounding rectangle,
     which is defined by points (&lt;x1&gt;, &lt;y1&gt;) and (&lt;x2&gt;, &lt;y2&gt;) for _pie
     and _pie_w and by points &lt;pwxy1&gt; and &lt;pwxy2&gt; for _pie_wxy. The
     pie starts where it intersects an imaginary line extending from
     the center of the arc through (&lt;x3&gt;, &lt;y3&gt;) for _pie and _pie_w
     and through &lt;pwxy3&gt; for _pie_wxy.
 
     The pie is drawn counterclockwise about the center of the arc,
     ending where it intersects an imaginary line extending from the
     center of the arc through (&lt;x4&gt;, &lt;y4&gt;) for _pie and _pie_w and
     through &lt;pwxy4&gt; for _pie_wxy. The wedge is drawn using the current
     color.
 
     The _pie routine uses the view coordinate system. The _pie_w and
     _pie_wxy functions use the real-valued window coordinate system.
     The arc is drawn using the current color. Since an arc does not
     define a closed area, it is not filled.
 
     The &lt;pwxy1&gt;, &lt;pwxy2&gt;, &lt;pwxy3&gt;, and &lt;pwxy4&gt; points are pointers of
     type struct _wxycoord, which is defined in GRAPH.H.
 
     Return Value
 
     The functions return a nonzero value if the pie is drawn
     successfully; otherwise, they return 0.

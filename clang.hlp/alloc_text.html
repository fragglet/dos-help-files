  Pragma:    alloc_text, same_seg
 
  Syntax:    #pragma alloc_text( textsegment, function1, ... )
             #pragma same_seg( variable1, ...)
 
  Summary:   The alloc_text pragma specifies the name of the segment
             where the specified function definitions are to reside.
             The alloc_text pragma does not handle C++ member functions
             or overloaded functions. Use of the __based keyword is
             preferred when it is necessary to specify the segment in
             which a function resides. The alloc_text pragma is supported
             for compatibility with previous versions of Microsoft C.
 
  NOTE: The same_seg pragma is no longer supported. In previous
        versions of Microsoft C, the same_seg pragma instructed the
        compiler to assume that the specified external variables were
        allocated in the same data segment. Use of the __based keyword
        is preferred when it is necessary to specify the segment in
        which external variables reside.
 
  See also:  __based, check_stack
 
     The alloc_text pragma gives you source-level control over the
     segment in which particular functions are allocated.
 
     If you use overlays or swapping techniques to handle large
     programs, alloc_text allows you to tune the contents of their text
     segments for maximum efficiency. The alloc_text pragma must appear
     after the declarations of any of the specified functions and
     before the definitions of these functions.
 
     Functions referenced in an alloc_text pragma should be defined in
     the same module as the pragma. If this is not done and an
     undefined function is later compiled into a different text
     segment, the error may or may not be caught. Although the program
     will usually run correctly, the function will not be allocated in
     the intended segments.
 
     Other limitations on alloc_text are as follows:
 
        ■ It cannot be used inside a function.
 
        ■ It must be used after the function has been declared, but
          before the function has been defined.
 
     Functions given in an alloc_text pragma can be implicitly near
     (because the small or compact memory model is used) or explicitly
     near (declared with the near keyword), provided they are
     called only by functions in the same segment.
 
     The following example shows code that may result in these
     problems:
 
           // Module 1
          #pragma  alloc_text( SEG1, sample, example )
          int sample( int i )
          {
              i = example( 10 );
          }
 
          // Module 2
          int example( int i )
          {
              return i * i;
          }
 
     You can prevent problems in the preceding code by placing the
     definitions of the functions sample and example in the same
     module.

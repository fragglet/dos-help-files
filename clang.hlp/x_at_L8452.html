     The _wgetexit function returns a value that indicates how a
     QuickWin program will behave when the exit function is called.
 
     QuickWin programs can optionally keep their windows on the screen
     after termination. How a program will behave at exit time depends
     on its current exit behavior setting. The _wgetexit function lets
     you examine the current exit behavior setting. This routine is
     used only in QuickWin programs; it is not part of the Windows
     API. For full details about QuickWin, see Chapter 8 of the
     Programming Techniques manual.
 
     If the companion function _wsetexit has been called previously,
     _wgetexit returns the value that it set. This can be one of the
     following values:
 
     Value                 Meaning
 
     _WINEXITPROMPT        Prompt the user at exit time to
                           determine whether the windows stay
                           on the screen or not
     _WINEXITNOPERSIST     The windows do not stay on the screen
                           and there is no prompt to the user
     _WINEXITPERSIST       The windows stay on the screen at
                           exit, without prompting the user
 
     If _wsetexit has not been called previously, the _wgetexit
     function returns _WINEXITPERSIST, the default exit behavior. For
     a description of how to use this exit behavior, see _wsetexit.
 
     Return Value
 
     The _wgetexit function returns the current exit setting. A return
     value of -1 indicates an error.

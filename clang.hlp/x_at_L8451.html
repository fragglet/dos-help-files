     The _wclose function closes a QuickWin window. The window must
     have been previously opened with the QuickWin function _wopen.
     This routine is used only in QuickWin programs; it is not part of
     the Windows API. For full details about QuickWin, see Chapter 8
     of the Programming Techniques manual.
 
     To close a window opened with _wopen, pass its file handle to
     _wclose. To close a window opened with _fwopen, call the STDIO.H
     function fclose.
 
     The &lt;persist&gt; flag can have one of the following values:
 
     Value             Meaning
 
     _WINNOPERSIST     Erase the closed window
     _WINPERSIST       Leave the window on the screen
 
     If the window remains on the screen, another _wclose call to the
     same file handle with _WINNOPERSIST removes it. While the window
     remains visible, the user can copy and paste text in it, choose
     QuickWin menus, and operate the window's scroll bars.
 
     Regardless of which &lt;persist&gt; option is used, the window's file
     handle is closed to all further I/O. If a window is opened with the
     same title as a window closed with persistence, it will be a
     different window. Windows closed with persistence count against the
     total number of open windows (20 by default).
 
     Return Value
 
     The _wclose function returns 0 if successful. A return value of -1
     indicates an error, and errno is set to EBADF, indicating an
     invalid file-handle argument.

  Variable:  _environ
 
  Include:   &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
 
  Syntax:    char *_environ[];
 
     The _environ variable is an array of pointers to the strings that
     constitute the process environment. The environment consists of
     one or more entries of the form
 
          NAME=string
 
     where NAME is the name of an environment variable and &lt;string&gt; is
     the value of that variable. The string can be empty. The initial
     environment settings are taken from the operating-system
     environment at the time of program execution.
 
     The getenv and _putenv routines use the _environ variable to
     access and modify the environment table. When _putenv is called to
     add or delete environment settings, the environment table changes
     size. Its location in memory can also change, depending on the
     program's memory requirements. The _environ variable is adjusted
     in these cases and will always point to the correct table
     location.

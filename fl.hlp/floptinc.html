─────Searching for Include Files (/I, /X)───────────────────────────────────
 
     The /I and /X options temporarily override the environment
     variable INCLUDE.
 
     Syntax: /Idirectory [/Idirectory...]
             /X
 
     These options give special handling to a particular file or files,
     without changing the normal compiler environment.
 
     The /I option causes the compiler to search the specified
     directory or directories before searching the directories given by
     the INCLUDE environment variable.
 
     The directories are searched only until the include file specified
     in the source file is found. If the file cannot be found, the
     compiler prints an error message and stops processing.
 
     The following list describes the compiler's search order for
     include files:
 
       1. All directories specified in the source file by the INCLUDE
          statement or the <a href='unknown#_INCLUDE'>$INCLUDE</a> metacommand.
 
       2. The directories specified in each /I option.
 
       3. The places specified in the INCLUDE environment variable.
 
     The /X option stops the compiler from searching the standard
     places given by the INCLUDE environment variable. When /X is
     given, FL considers the list of standard places to be empty.
     Directories referenced in /I options, INCLUDE statements,
     and the <a href='unknown#_INCLUDE'>$INCLUDE</a> metacommand are still searched.
 
     Both /I and /X apply only to source files following the option on
     the command line. /X can be followed by one or more /I options.

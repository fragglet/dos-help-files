    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<b>Cursor Movement Commands</b>
 
The following prefix commands can precede any of the movement commands:
  Prefix   Description
  B        Move, but do not plot any points.
  N        Move, but return to original position when done.
 
The following commands specify movement in units. The default unit size
is one point; this unit size can be modified by the S command, which sets
the scale factor. If no argument is supplied, the cursor is moved one unit.
(S is described in "Angle, Color, and Scale-Factor Commands.")
 
Each of the movement commands initiates movement from the current
graphics position, which is usually the coordinate of the last
graphics point plotted with another graphics macro-language command.
The current position defaults to the center of the screen when a
program is run.
 
  Movement   Description
  U [n]      Move up n units.
  D [n]      Move down n units.
  L [n]      Move left n units.
  R [n]      Move right n units.
  E [n]      Move diagonally up and right n units.
  F [n]      Move diagonally down and right n units.
  G [n]      Move diagonally down and left n units.
  H [n]      Move diagonally up and left n units.
  M x,y      Move absolute or relative. If x is preceded by a plus
             (+) or minus (-), the movement is relative to the
             current point; that is, x and y are added to (or
             subtracted from) the coordinates of the current
             graphics position and connected with that position by
             a line.
 
             If no sign precedes x, the movement is absolute; that
             is, a line is drawn from the current cursor position to
             the point with coordinates x,y.

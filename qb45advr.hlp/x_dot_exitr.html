<b>EXIT Statement Details</b>
 
<b>Syntax</b>
  EXIT {DEF | DO | FOR | FUNCTION | SUB}
 
  Statement       Description
  EXIT DEF        Causes an immediate exit from the executing DEF FN
                  function. Program execution continues where the
                  DEF FN function was invoked.
 
  EXIT DO         Provides an alternative exit from a DO...LOOP. Can
                  be used only inside a DO...LOOP statement; EXIT DO
                  transfers control to the statement following the
                  LOOP statement. When used within nested DO...LOOP
                  statements, transfers out of the immediately
                  enclosing loop.
 
  EXIT FOR        Provides another way to exit a FOR...NEXT loop. May
                  appear only in a FOR...NEXT loop; transfers control
                  to the statement following the NEXT statement.
                  When used within nested FOR...NEXT loops, transfers
                  out of the immediately enclosing loop.
 
  EXIT FUNCTION   Causes an immediate exit from a FUNCTION procedure.
                  Program execution continues where the FUNCTION was
                  invoked. Can only be used in a FUNCTION procedure.
 
  EXIT SUB        Immediately exits a SUB procedure. Program execution
                  continues with the statement after the CALL
                  statement. Can only be used in a SUB procedure.
 
None of the EXIT statements define the end of the structure in which
they are used. EXIT statements only provide an alternative exit from
the structure.

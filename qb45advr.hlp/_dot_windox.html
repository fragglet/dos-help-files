<b>WINDOW Statement Programming Example</b>
 
WINDO_EX.BAS is a program file in the subdirectory ADVR_EX that illustrates
the WINDOW statement. To look at the program in the View window and,
optionally, to run it, load it using the File menu's Open Program command.
 
The program shows how changing the window size changes the size of a figure
drawn on the screen. The effect is one of zooming in and out; as the window
gets smaller, the figure appears larger on the screen, until parts of it
are finally clipped because they lie outside the window. As the window gets
larger, the figure appears smaller on the screen.

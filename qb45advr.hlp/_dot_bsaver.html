<b>BSAVE Statement Details</b>
 
<b>Syntax</b>
  BSAVE filespec,offset,length
 
  filespec    A string expression containing the file or device name.
              Output devices other than the console (SCRN: and CONS:)
              are supported.
  offset      The offset of the starting address of the area in memory
              to be saved.
  length      The number of bytes to save. This is a numeric
              expression returning an unsigned integer in the range
              0-65,535.
 
The BSAVE statement allows data or programs to be saved as memory-image
files on disk. A memory-image file is a byte-for-byte copy of what
is in memory along with control information used by BLOAD to
load the file.
 
  Note: Programs written in earlier versions of BASIC no longer work
        if they use VARPTR to access numeric arrays.
 
The starting address of the area saved is determined by the offset
and the most recent DEF SEG statement.
 
If no DEF SEG statement is executed before the BSAVE statement,
the program uses the default BASIC data segment (DS). Otherwise,
BSAVE begins saving at the address specified by the offset and
by the segment set in the most recent DEF SEG statement.
 
If the offset is a single- or double-precision floating-point value,
it is coerced to an integer. If the offset is a negative number in
the range -1 to -32,768, it is treated as an unsigned 2-byte offset.
 
  Note: Because different screen modes use memory differently, do not
        load graphic images in a screen mode other than the one used
        when the images were created.
 
<b>Differences From BASICA</b>
 
BSAVE does not support the cassette device.

<b>Constants</b>
 
Constants are predefined values that do not change during program execution.
 
<b>String Constants</b>
 
A string constant is a sequence of alphanumeric characters enclosed by
double quotation marks.
 
These alphanumeric characters can be any of the characters whose ASCII codes
fall within the range 0-255 (except the double quote character (") and
carriage-return/line-feed sequences). This range includes both the actual
ASCII characters (0-127) and the extended characters (128-255).
 
<b>Numeric Constants</b>
 
Numeric constants are positive or negative numbers. Numeric constants in
BASIC cannot contain commas. The types and subtypes of constants are
listed below:
 
<b>Type (subtype)      Description</b>
 
Integer             One or more decimal digits (0-9), with an optional sign
(decimal)           prefix  (+ or -). The range for integer decimal
                    constants is -32,768 to +32,767.
 
Integer             One or more hexadecimal digits (0-9, a-f, or
(hexadecimal)       A-F) with the prefix &amp;H or &amp;h. The range for integer
                    hexadecimal constants is &amp;h0 to &amp;hFFFF.
 
Integer             One or more octal digits (0-7) with the prefix &amp;O, &amp;o,
(octal)             or &amp;. The range for integer octal constants is &amp;o0 to
                    &amp;o177777.
 
Long integer        One or more decimal digits (0-9), with an optional sign
(decimal)           prefix (+ or -) and the suffix &amp;. The range for long
                    decimal constants is -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647.
 
Long integer        One or more hexadecimal digits (0-9, a-f, or A-F) with
(hexadecimal)       the prefix &amp;H or &amp;h and the suffix &amp;. The range for
                    long hexadecimal constants is &amp;h0&amp; to &amp;hFFFFFFFF&amp;.
 
Long integer        One or more octal digits (0-7) with the prefix &amp;O, &amp;o,
(octal)             or &amp; and the suffix &amp;. The range for long octal
                    constants is &amp;o0&amp; to &amp;o37777777777&amp;.
 
Fixed point         Positive or negative real numbers (numbers containing
                    decimal points).
 
Floating point      Positive or negative numbers represented in exponential
(single precision)  form. A single-precision floating-point constant is an
                    optionally signed integer or fixed-point number (the
                    mantissa) followed by the letter E and an optionally
                    signed integer (the exponent). The constant's value is
                    the mantissa multiplied by the power of ten represented
                    by the exponent. Single-precision constants have a
                    range of -3.37E+38 to 3.37E+38.
 
Floating point      Double-precision floating-point constants have the same
(double precision)  form as single-precision floating-point constants, but
                    use D, rather than E, to indicate the exponent. Double-
                    precision constants have a range of -1.67D+308 to
                    1.67D+308.
 
<b>Single-precision constants</b>
 
Single-precision numeric constants are stored with 7 digits of precision
(plus the exponent). Double-precision numbers are stored with 15 or 16
digits of precision (plus the exponent).
 
A single-precision constant is any numeric constant that has one of the
following properties:
  ■ Exponential form denoted by E
  ■ A trailing exclamation mark (!)
  ■ A value containing a decimal point that does not have a D in the
    exponent or a trailing number sign (#) and that has fewer than
    15 digits
  ■ A value without a decimal point that has fewer than 15 digits
    but cannot be represented as a long-integer value
 
<b>Double-precision constants</b>
 
A double-precision constant is any numeric constant that has one of the
following properties:
  ■ Exponential form denoted by D
  ■ A trailing number sign (#)
  ■ A decimal point, no E in the exponent or trailing exclamation
    mark (!), and more than 15 digits
 
<b>Symbolic Constants</b>
 
BASIC provides symbolic constants that can be used in place of numeric or
string values. The following fragment declares two symbolic constants and
uses one to dimension an array:
 
  CONST MAXCHARS% = 254, MAXBUF% = MAXCHARS% + 1
  DIM Buffer%(MAXBUF%)
 
The name of a symbolic constant follows the same rules as a BASIC variable
name. You may include a type-declaration character (%, #, !, or $) in the
name to indicate its type, but this character is not part of the name. For
example, after the following declaration, the names N!, N#, N$, N%, and N&amp;
cannot be used as variable names because they have the same name as the
constant:
 
  CONST N=45
 
A constant's type is determined either by an explicit type-declaration
character or the type of the expression. Symbolic constants are unaffected
by DEFtype statements.
 
If you omit the type-declaration character, the constant is given a type
based on the expression. Strings always yield a string constant. With
numeric expressions, the expression is evaluated and the constant is given
the simplest type that can represent it. For example, if the expression
gives a result that can be represented as an integer, the constant is given
an integer type.

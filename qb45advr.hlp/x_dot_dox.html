<b>DO...LOOP Statement Programming Examples</b>
 
Following are four examples. The first two examples show you how
placement of the condition affects the number of times the block
of statements is executed. The third example shows how a loop can
be used to pause a program until the user presses a key. The fourth
example illustrates testing at the end of a loop and presents
a sort subprogram where an ending test is appropriate.
 
<b>DO...LOOP Programming Example 1</b>
 
In the following example, the test is done at the beginning of the
loop. Because I is not less than 10, the body of the loop (the
statement block) is never executed.
 
' DO...LOOP with test at the top of the loop.
' Output shows that loop was not executed.
I = 10
PRINT "Value of I at beginning of loop is  ";I
DO WHILE I &lt; 10
   I = I + 1
LOOP
PRINT "Value of I at end of loop is  ";I
 
<b>Example 1 Sample Output</b>
 
Value of I at beginning of loop is  10
Value of I at end of loop is  10
 
<b>DO...LOOP Programming Example 2</b>
 
The following example tests I at the end of the loop, so the
statement block executes at least once.
 
' DO...LOOP with test at the bottom of the loop.
' Output shows loop was executed once.
I = 10
DO
   PRINT "Value of I at beginning of loop is  ";I
   I = I + 1
LOOP WHILE I &lt; 10
PRINT "Value of I at end of loop is  ";I
 
<b>Example 2 Sample Output</b>
 
Value of I at beginning of loop is  10
Value of I at end of loop is 11
 
<b>DO...LOOP Programming Example 3</b>
 
In the following example, the DO...LOOP continues testing the length
of Choice$ at the bottom of the loop.  When the user presses a key,
the length of Choice$ becomes greater than zero and the loop terminates.
 
' DO...LOOP with test at the bottom of the loop.
DO
   Choice$ = INKEY$
LOOP WHILE Choice$ = ""
 
<b>DO...LOOP Programming Example 4</b>
 
The following sort program tests at the end of the loop because
the entire array must be examined at least once to see if it is in
order. In general, test at the end of a loop only if you know that
you always want the statement block executed at least once.
 
' Set up a special value to indicate no exchanges.
'
CONST NOEXCH = -1
DIM Exes(12)
FOR I = 1 TO 12
   Exes(I) = 13 - I
NEXT I
Limit = 12
CLS                                  'Clear the screen
PRINT "This is the list of numbers to sort:"
FOR I = 1 TO 12
   PRINT Exes(I);
NEXT I
LOCATE 4,1: INPUT "Press any key to continue", Gar$
DO
   Exchange = NOEXCH
   FOR I = 1 TO Limit - 1            ' Make one pass over the array.
      IF Exes(I) &gt; Exes(I+1) THEN
         SWAP Exes(I), Exes(I+1)     'Exchange array elements.
         Exchange = I                'Record location of most
      END IF                         'recent exchange.
   NEXT I
   Limit = Exchange                  'Sort on next pass only to where
                                     'last exchange was done.
LOOP UNTIL Exchange = NOEXCH         'Sort until no elements are exchanged.
'
PRINT
PRINT "Sorting is completed. This is the sorted list:"
FOR I = 1 TO 12
   PRINT Exes(I);
NEXT I
END
 
<b>Sample Output</b>
 
This is the list of numbers to sort:
 12  11  10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1
 
Press any key to continue
 
This is the sorted list:
 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12

<b>VIEW (Graphics) Statement Details</b>
 
<b>Syntax</b>
  VIEW [[SCREEN] (x1,y1)-(x2,y2) [,[color][,border]]]
 
  Argument          Description
  SCREEN            When SCREEN is used, the x and y coordinates are
                    absolute to the screen, not relative to the border
                    of the physical viewport. Only graphics within the
                    viewport are plotted. When SCREEN is omitted, all
                    points are plotted relative to the viewport (x1
                    and x2 are added to coordinates before plotting
                    the point).
  (x1,y1)-(x2,y2)   Indicates a rectangular area on the screen. The
                    placeholders x1, y1, x2, and y2 are numeric
                    expressions that are the coordinates of diagonally
                    opposite corners of the area.
  color             The color attribute of the color used to fill the
                    area. If you omit color, the area is not filled.
  border            Any numeric expression in this area draws a line
                    around the viewport if space is available. If you
                    omit border, no border is drawn.
 
The VIEW statement defines a "physical viewport," or a rectangular
section of the screen into which graphics can be mapped. All
coordinates used in the statement must be within the physical bounds
of the screen.
 
If VIEW is given with no arguments, the entire screen is defined
as the viewport. RUN and SCREEN also define the entire screen as the
viewport and disable any viewports defined with VIEW.

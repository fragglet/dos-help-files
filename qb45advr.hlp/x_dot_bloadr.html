    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<b>BLOAD Statement Details</b>
 
<b>Syntax</b>
  BLOAD filespec [,offset]
 
  Argument    Description
  filespec    A string expression containing the file specification.
              Input devices other than the keyboard (KYBD:) are
              supported.
 
  offset      The offset of the address where loading is to start.
 
The BLOAD statement allows a program or data saved as a memory-image
file to be loaded anywhere in memory. A memory-image file is a byte-
for-byte copy of what was originally in memory.
 
  Note: Programs written in earlier versions of BASIC no longer work
        if they use VARPTR to access numeric arrays.
 
The starting address for loading is determined by the specified offset
and the most recent DEF SEG statement. If offset is omitted, the
segment address and offset contained in the file (the address used in
the BSAVE statement) are used. Thus, the file is loaded at the address
used when saving the file.
 
If you supply an offset, the segment address used is the segment set
by the most recently executed DEF SEG statement. If there has been no
DEF SEG statement, the BASIC data segment (DS) is used as the default.
 
If the offset is a single-precision or double-precision number it
is coerced to an integer. If the offset is a negative number in the
range -1 to -32,768, it is treated as an unsigned 2-byte offset.
 
  Note: Because BLOAD does not perform an address-range check, it is
        possible to load a file anywhere in memory. You must be careful
        not to write over BASIC or the operating system.
 
Since different screen modes use memory differently, do not load
graphic images in a screen mode other than the one used when they were
created.
 
Also, because BASIC program code and data items are not always stored
in the same locations as they were in BASICA, do not use BLOAD with
files created by BASICA programs.
                           ----------------
 
<b>Differences from BASICA</b>
 
BLOAD does not support the cassette device.

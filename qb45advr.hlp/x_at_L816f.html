<b>PRINT # Statement Details</b>
 
<b>Syntax</b>
  PRINT # filenumber, [USING stringexpression;] expressionlist [{,|;}]
 
The filenumber is the number specified when the file was opened for
output. The stringexpression consists of formatting characters as
described under PRINT USING. The expressions in expressionlist are
the numeric or string expressions to be written to the file. Spaces,
commas, and semicolons in the expressionlist have the same meaning
they have in a PRINT statement.
 
If you omit expressionlist, the PRINT # statement prints a blank line
in the file.
 
PRINT # works like PRINT and writes an image of the data to the file,
just as the data would be displayed on the terminal screen. For this
reason, be careful to delimit the data so it is output correctly. If
you use commas as delimiters, the blanks between print fields are
also written to the file.

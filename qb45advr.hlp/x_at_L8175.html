<b>PUT (Graphics Statement) Statement Details</b>
 
<b>Syntax</b>
  PUT [STEP](x, y),arrayname[(indices)][,actionverb]
 
  Argument     Description
  STEP         Indicates that the given x and y coordinates are
               relative, not absolute. The coordinates are treated as
               distances from the most recent cursor location, not
               distances from the (0,0) screen coordinate.
 
               For example, if the most recent point referenced were
               (10,10) then
                 PUT STEP (10,5),Ball
               would put the object stored in Ball at (20,15).
 
  (x,y)        Coordinates specifying the top-left corner of the
               rectangle enclosing the image to be placed in the
               current output window.
  arrayname    The name of the array that holds the image. See the
               entry for GET (Graphics) for the formula that computes
               the size of this array. The array can be a
               multidimensional array.
  indices      Specifies that the image is retrieved starting from the
               designated array element, rather than at the first
               array element.
  actionverb   The actionverb determines the interaction between the
               stored image and the one already on the screen.
 
The different values for actionverb are described in the following
list. The default actionverb is XOR.
 
  Verb    Description
  PSET     Transfers the data point-by-point onto the screen. Each
           point has the exact color attribute it had when it was
           taken from the screen with GET.
  PRESET   The same as PSET except that a negative image (for
           example, black on white) is produced.
  AND      Used when the image is to be transferred over an existing
           image on the screen. The resulting image is the result of
           a logical AND of the stored image and the screen; points
           that had the same color in both the existing image and the
           stored image remain the same color, while those points that
           do not have the same color in both the existing image and
           the stored image do not.
  OR       Used to superimpose the image onto an existing image; the
           stored image does not erase the previous screen contents.
           The resulting image is the product of a logical OR of the
           stored image and the screen image.
  XOR      A special mode often used for animation. XOR causes the
           points on the screen to be inverted where a point exists in
           the array image. This behavior is exactly like that of the
           cursor: when an image is placed on the screen against a
           complex background twice, the background is restored. This
           allows you to move an object around the screen without
           erasing the background.

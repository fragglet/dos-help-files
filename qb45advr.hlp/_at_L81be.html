<b>STRIG Function Details</b>
 
<b>Syntax</b>
  STRIG(n)
 
The STRIG function is used to test the joystick trigger status. In previous
versions of BASIC, the statement STRIG ON enables testing of the joystick
triggers; STRIG OFF disables joystick trigger testing. QuickBASIC ignores
STRIG ON and STRIG OFF statements--the statements are provided for
compatibility with earlier versions.
 
The numeric expression n is an unsigned integer in the range 0-7, indicating
the joystick and trigger to check. The following list describes the values
returned by the STRIG(n) function for different values of n:
 
  Argument   Value Returned
  0          -1 if the lower button on joystick A was pressed since
             the last STRIG(0) call, 0 if not
 
  1          -1 if the lower button on joystick A is currently down,
             0 if not
 
  2          -1 if the lower button on joystick B was pressed since
             the last STRIG(2) call, 0 if not
 
  3          -1 if the lower button on joystick B is currently down,
             0 if not
 
  4          -1 if the upper button on joystick A was pressed since
             the last STRIG(4) call, 0 if not
 
  5          -1 if the upper button on joystick A is currently down,
             0 if not
 
  6          -1 if the upper button on joystick B was pressed since
             the last STRIG(6) call, 0 if not
 
  7          -1 if the upper button on joystick B is currently down,
             0 if not
 
You can also use event trapping to get information from the joystick
by using the ON STRIG statement. You cannot use the STRIG function
inside a joystick event trap because the event that caused the trap is
destroyed.
 
<b>Differences from BASICA</b>
 
If you are compiling from the BC command line, you must use the /V or /W
option if a program contains a STRIG statement.

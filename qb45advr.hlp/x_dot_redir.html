    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<b>REDIM Statement Details</b>
 
<b>Syntax</b>
  REDIM [SHARED] variable(subscripts)[AS type]
                 [,variable(subscripts)[AS type]]...
 
  Arguments    Description
  SHARED       The optional SHARED attribute allows a module to share
               variables with all the procedures in the module; this
               differs from the SHARED statement, which affects only
               the variables within a single module. SHARED can only
               be used in REDIM statements in the module-level code.
  variable     A BASIC variable name.
  subscripts   The dimensions of the array. Multiple dimensions can be
               declared. The subscript syntax is described below.
  AS type      Declares variable as an elementary or user-defined
               type. The elementary types are INTEGER, LONG, SINGLE,
               DOUBLE, and STRING.
 
Subscripts in REDIM statements have the following form:
 
  [lower TO] upper [,[lower TO] upper]...
 
The TO keyword provides a way to indicate both the lower and the upper
bounds of an array's subscripts. The arguments lower and upper are numeric
expressions specifying the lowest and highest value for the subscript.
See the <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='x_dot_dimr.html'>DIM statement details<span class='grhilite'>►</span></a> for more information about using the
TO keyword.
 
The REDIM statement changes the space allocated to an array that has been
declared $DYNAMIC.
 
When a REDIM statement is compiled, all arrays declared in the statement
are treated as dynamic. At run time, when a REDIM statement is executed,
the array is deallocated (if it is already allocated) and then reallocated
with the new dimensions. Old array-element values are lost because all
numeric elements are reset to 0, and all string elements are reset to null
strings.
 
  Note: Although you may change the size of an array's dimensions with
        the REDIM statement, you may not change the number of dimensions.
        For example, the following statements are legal:
 
          ' $DYNAMIC
          DIM A(50,50)
          ERASE A
          REDIM A(20,15)    'Array A still has two dimensions.
 
        However, the following statements are not legal, and produce
        an error message that reads "Wrong number of dimensions":
 
          ' $DYNAMIC
          DIM A(50,50)
          ERASE A
          REDIM A(5,5,5)   'Changed number of dimensions from
                           'two to three.

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<b>VARPTR and VARSEG Functions Details</b>
 
<b>Syntax</b>
  VARPTR(variablename)
  VARSEG(variablename)
 
The variablename may be any BASIC variable, including a record variable
or record element. The VARPTR function returns an unsigned integer that
is the offset of the variable within its segment. The VARSEG function
returns an unsigned integer that is the segment part of the variable's
address. If variablename is not defined before VARPTR or VARSEG is called,
the variable is created and its address is returned. When variablename is
a string variable, VARPTR and VARSEG return the location of the first byte
of the string descriptor.
 
  Note: Because many BASIC statements change the locations of variables
        in memory, use the values returned by VARPTR and VARSEG
        immediately after the functions are used.
 
VARPTR and VARSEG are often used with BLOAD, BSAVE, CALL ABSOLUTE,
CALL INTERRUPT, PEEK, POKE, or when passing arrays to procedures
written in other languages.
 
When using VARPTR or VARSEG to get the address of an array,
use the first element of the array as the argument:
 
  DIM A(150)
  .
  .
  .
  ArrAddress=VARPTR(A(1))
 
  Note: You may no longer use VARPTR to get the address of a file's
        buffer. Use the function FILEATTR to get information about a
        file.
 
        In addition, programs written in earlier versions of BASIC
        that used VARPTR to access numeric arrays may no longer work.
        You must now use a combination of VARPTR and VARSEG. For example,
        the following QuickBASIC Version 3.0 fragment no longer works
        correctly:
 
            DIM Cube(675)
            .
            .
            .
           BSAVE "graph.dat",VARPTR(Cube(1)),2700
 
       The fragment would be rewritten as follows:
 
           DIM Cube(675)
           .
           .
           .
           ' Change segment to segment containing Cube.
           DEF SEG=VARSEG(Cube(1))
           BSAVE "graph.dat",VARPTR(Cube(1)),2700
           ' Restore BASIC segment.
           DEF SEG
 
You may use VARPTR alone to get the address of a variable stored in
DGROUP. You must use both VARPTR and VARSEG to get the complete
address of a variable stored as a far object.
 
The VARSEG function, combined with VARPTR, replaces the PTR86
subprogram used in previous versions of QuickBASIC.

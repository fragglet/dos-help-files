<b>DRAW Statement Details</b>
 
<b>Syntax</b>
  DRAW stringexpression
 
The DRAW statement combines many of the capabilities of the other
graphics statements into a graphics macro language. This macro language
defines a set of characteristics that can be used to describe an image.
These characteristics include motion (up, down, left, right), color,
rotation angle, and scale factor. The stringexpression consists of these
macro commands.
 
There are three types of macro commands:

  <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='_at_L80ad.html'>angle, color, and scale factor commands<span class='grhilite'>►</span></a>
  <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='_at_L80ae.html'>X, the substring command<span class='grhilite'>►</span></a>
 
<b>Differences from BASICA</b>
 
The DRAW statement requires modification of BASICA programs when used
with QuickBASIC. Specifically, the compiler requires the VARPTR$ form
for variables. Statements such as the following:
 
  DRAW "XA$"
  DRAW "TA = ANGLE"
 
(where A$ and ANGLE are variables) must be changed as follows:
 
  DRAW "X" + VARPTR$(A$)
  DRAW "TA =" + VARPTR$(ANGLE)
 
when using the compiler.
 
The compiler does not support the Xstringexpression command. However,
you may execute a substring by appending the character form of the
address to X. For example, the following two statements are
equivalent. The first statement works when within the environment
and when using the compiler, while the second works only within the
environment.
 
  DRAW "X" + VARPTR$(A$)
  DRAW "XA$"

<pre>■ You have used a number that is inappropriate for the
  context in which it is used. For example, Visual Basic does
  not allow you to declare a fixed-length string of zero
  length, so DIM X AS STRING * 0 is illegal.
 
■ An illegal number also occurs if you declare contradictory
  values. For example, using an integer type-declaration
  character with a floating-point number (for example, 10.20%)
  causes this error.
 
■ Possible solution:
 
  • Verify that you are not using a number that is
    inappropriate for its context and that you are not
    declaring contradictory values.
 
■ If you need additional help, move the cursor to a keyword

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>■ Visual Basic is about to save a file and finds one or more
  include files loaded into memory but not saved to disk
  since they were modified.
 
■ Possible solutions:
 
  • Choose:
    ╔════════╗
    ║  Yes   ║ To save the modified include files and then
    ╚════════╝ save the program file.
    ┌────────┐
    │   No   │ To save the program file (but not the modified
    └────────┘ include files) if you are still experimenting
               with the include file.
    ┌────────┐
    │ Cancel │ Or press Esc if you don't want to save any
    └────────┘ files.
 
■ If you need additional help, move the cursor to a keyword
  and press F1 to open the Help window.

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>■ Displays the Calls window, which records and displays all
  procedure calls executed prior to:
    • An untrapped error
    • A breakpoint or watchpoint
    • Pressing Ctrl+Break
 
■ Procedures are displayed in the order they are executed,
  with the most recent at the top.
 
■ To use the Calls window:
    1. Select a procedure name from the Calls window.
       • When the procedure text is displayed, the cursor
         will be on the line following the call that led
         to the point where execution halted.
    2. Press F7 to restart execution from that point to
       the cursor location.
 
■ Tip: Use the Debug window to look at variable values
       returned from procedures lower in the stack.
 
■ A bullet (•) appears next to the command name on the Window
  menu when the Calls window is the active window.

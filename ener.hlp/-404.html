    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<div class="page-title"> File already exists. Overwrite?</div>
<pre>■ You are about to overwrite a file that already exists on
  disk.
 
■ Possible solutions:
 
  • Choose:
    ┌────────┐
    │  Yes   │ To overwrite the file contents on disk with
    └────────┘ the file contents in memory. Note: Be sure
               that overwriting the contents of the file on
               disk won't cause you to lose valuable
               information.
    ╔════════╗
    ║   No   ║ To redisplay the dialog box and type a unique
    ╚════════╝ disk-file name for saving the file in memory.
    ┌────────┐
    │ Cancel │ To cancel the command, leaving everything just
    └────────┘ as it was before you chose the command.
 
■ If you need additional help, move the cursor to a keyword
  and press F1 to open the Help window.

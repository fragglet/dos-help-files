    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>■ One or more include files that have not been saved since
  last modified are loaded into memory. Visual Basic needs
  to know which version of the include files you want to run.
 
■ Possible solutions:
 
  • Choose:
    ╔════════╗
    ║  Yes   ║ To save the modified include files and run
    ╚════════╝ the program.
    ┌────────┐
    │   No   │ To run the program with the versions that are
    └────────┘ currently on disk (the unmodified versions).
    ┌────────┐
    │ Cancel │ If you don't want to run the program.
    └────────┘
 
■ If you need additional help, move the cursor to a keyword
  and press F1 to open the Help window.

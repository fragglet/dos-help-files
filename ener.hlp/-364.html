<pre>■ You tried to unload an object that has already been
  unloaded. For example, you may have unloaded a form
  from its own Form_Load event procedure while an
  implicit load occurred. For example:
 
         Form1.BackColor = Form2.BackColor
 
■ Possible solutions:
 
  • Remove UNLOAD statement from the form's Load event
    procedure.
 
  • Verify that you are not trying to unload an object that
    has already been removed from memory.
 
■ If you need additional help, move the cursor to a keyword
  and press F1 to open the Help window.

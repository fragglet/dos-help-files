<pre>■ User-defined type identifier and record element names cannot
  contain periods.
 
■ A variable name cannot contain a period if the part of the
  name preceding the period has been used in an AS usertype
  clause anywhere in the program.
 
■ Although variable names can contain periods, it's a good
  idea to use a period only as a record variable separator.
 
■ Possible solution:
 
  • If you have programs that use a period in variable names,
    you could change them to use mixed case instead. For
    example, variable ALPHA.BETA would become AlphaBeta.
 
■ If you need additional help, move the cursor to a keyword
  and press F1 to open the Help window.

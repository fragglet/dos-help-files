    statement.

    be found, or explicit reference to the object is required.

    statements.
 
  • During an ISAM OPEN FOR operation, the data type of a
    record element does not match the data type of a table
    column.
 
  • During an ISAM INSERT operation, the number of elements in
    the record does not match the number of columns in table,
    or the data type of a record element does not match the
    data type of a table column.
 
  • During an ISAM RETRIEVE operation, the data type of a
    record element does not match the data type of a table
    column.
 
  • In an ISAM SEEKoperand statement, there is a data type
    mismatch between the keyvalue argument and the current
    index.

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>■ Leaves the Form Designer
 
■ If you started the Form Designer from MS-DOS, you will be
  returned to the MS-DOS prompt. If you started the Form
  Designer by choosing New Form or View Form from within
  Visual Basic, you will be returned to the programming
  environment.
 
■ Note: If a new or changed form has not been saved, the
        Form Designer prompts you to confirm before exiting.

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>■ At compile time, this error occurs when include files are
  nested more than five levels deep.
 
■ At run time, more than one condition can cause this error:
 
  • Visual Basic has a limit to the number of disk files that
    can be open at one time. This limit is a function of the
    FILES= parameter in your CONFIG.SYS file.
 
  • The operating system has a limit to the number of entries
    in a root directory.
 
  • ISAM has a limit to the number of databases and tables
    that can be open at one time and your program has exceeded
    this limit.
 
■ Possible solutions:
 
  • Increase the number of files defined by FILES= in your
    CONFIG.SYS file and reboot your computer.
 
  • If your program is opening, closing, or saving files in
    the root directory, change your program so it uses a
    subdirectory.
 
  • ISAM can open up to 4 databases and 4 to 13 tables
    (depending on the number of databases open). Change your
    program so it closes tables or databases that exceed this
    limit.
 
■ If you need additional help, move the cursor to a keyword
  and press F1 to open the Help window.

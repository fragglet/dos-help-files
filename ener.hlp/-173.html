    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>■ The Immediate window is used to:
   • Test problematic, debugged, or new code
   • Simulate a run-time error
   • Query or change variable values while running an
     application
   • Call procedures as you would in code
 
 ■ While working in the Immediate window, you can:
     • Execute only one line of code at a time
     • Type or paste a line of code and press Enter to
       run it
     • Copy and paste code (although you cannot save it)
 
 ■ In break mode, a statement in the Immediate window is
   executed in the context of the halted program. For
   example, if you type:
 
        PRINT Var1
 
   Your output is the value of the local variable Var1. This
   is the same as if the PRINT statement had actually occurred
   in the procedure you were executing when the program
   halted.
 
 ■ To open the Immediate window, choose Immediate Window from
   the Window menu.
 
 ■ To close the Immediate window, choose Close from the
   Control menu or double-click the Control-menu box.
 
 ■ To see which error message dialog box is associated with a
   given error code, type:
 
        ERROR errornumber
 
■ A bullet (•) appears next to the command name on the Window
  menu when the Immediate window is the active window.

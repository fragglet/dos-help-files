<pre>■ A variable declared with an AS clause is referenced without
  that clause.
 
■ If the first declaration of a variable has an AS clause,
  every subsequent DIM, REDIM, SHARED, or COMMON statement
  that refers to that variable must have an AS clause.
 
■ Possible solution:
 
  • Remove the AS clause from the initial variable
    declaration or add an AS clause to the invalid reference.
 
■ If you need additional help, move the cursor to a keyword
  and press F1 to open the Help window.

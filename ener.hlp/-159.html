    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>■ Turns breakpoints on and off. Breakpoints tell Visual
  Basic to halt just before a specific line of code is
  executed.
 
■ Use breakpoints to halt your project at a point where you
  suspect problems, then:
    • Test variable values in the Immediate window or with
      the Instant Watch command
    • Add variables to the Debug window and single step your
      project from the breakpoint forward
 
■ To set a breakpoint:
    1. Move the cursor to the line you want the breakpoint
       on
    2. Choose Toggle Breakpoint (or press F9) and the
       environment highlights the breakpoint line
 
■ To turn off a breakpoint:
    1. Move the cursor to a highlighted breakpoint line
    2. Choose Toggle Breakpoint
 
■ Tip: Use Clear All Breakpoints to remove all breakpoints
       in your project.

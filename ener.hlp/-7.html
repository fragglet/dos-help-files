<pre>■ More memory was required for an operation than is available.
 
■ Possible solutions:
 
  • Exit the Visual Basic programming environment (VBDOS.EXE)
    and restart using the /S:n command-line option. The /S:n
    option sets the in-memory size of the programming
    environment. Smaller values of n will result in more
    conventional memory for your program. Larger values of
    n will result in less memory, but greater speed while
    working within the programming environment. Refer to the
    Help topic "Command-Line Options" for more information.
 
  • Reduce the size of your MS-DOS buffers.
 
  • Eliminate any terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs.
 
  • Eliminate some device drivers.
 
  • Make your programs smaller.
 
  • In the programming environment, unload any documents,
    source files, or include files that are in memory but not
    needed.
 
■ Use the FRE function to determine the amount of memory taken
  up by an object or your program.
 
■ If you are using Visual Basic and expanded memory, make sure
  that expanded memory is available:
  • Execute PRINT FRE(-3) in the Immediate window. The value
    returned shows available expanded memory.
  • If PRINT FRE(-3) causes the error message, "Feature
    unavailable," check to see if you are using LIM-4.0-
    compatible EMM memory and driver.
  • Check to see if you are making the best use of expanded
    memory.
 
■ You may be out of space in DGROUP even if you have space
  left in far memory, expanded memory, or extended memory.
  Execute PRINT FRE(-1) in the Immediate window. If the value
  returned is greater than 1K, you can free up some space in
  DGROUP by:
  • Reducing the number of dynamic string arrays.
  • Reducing the stack size.
 
■ If you need additional help, move the cursor to a keyword
  and press F1 to open the Help window.

<pre>■ You have double-clicked an object in the Form Designer and
  you are about to leave the Form Designer and return to the
  programming environment.
 
■ Unlike the Windows version, Visual Basic for MS-DOS does
  not allow you to add code by double-clicking a form or
  control.
 
■ Possible solutions:
 
  • Choose:
    ╔════════╗
    ║   OK   ║ Or press Enter to leave the Form Designer
    ╚════════╝ and return to the programming environment.
    ┌────────┐
    │ Cancel │ To cancel the operation and remain in the
    └────────┘ Form Designer.
 
  • If you started the Form Designer from the programming
    environment:
    ♦ Press F12 or choose Event Procedures from the Edit menu
      to return to the programming environment and open the
      Event Procedures dialog.
    ♦ Choose Code from the View menu to return to the
      programming environment and open the View Code dialog.
    ♦ Press Alt+F4 to return to the programming environment.
 
■ If you need additional help, move the cursor to a keyword
  and press F1 to open the Help window.

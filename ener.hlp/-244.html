    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>■ SUB...END SUB and FUNCTION...END FUNCTION statement blocks
  are not permitted in include files. In general, it is not
  recommended that you place any executable code in include
  files.
 
■ Possible solution:
 
  • Choose Load Text from the File menu to insert the include
    file into the current module, or load the include file as
    a separate module.
 
■ Note: If you load the include file as a separate module,
  some restructuring may be necessary because shared
  variables are shared only within the scope of the module.
 
■ If you need additional help, move the cursor to a keyword
  and press F1 to open the Help window.

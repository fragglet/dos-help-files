<div class="page-title"> QuickLib has not freed its memory resource</div>
<pre>■ The quick library you have loaded has allocated memory
  that has not been deallocated prior to performing one
  of the following operations from within the programming
  environment:
  • Making an executable file (Make .EXE dialog)
  • Starting the Form Designer (FD.EXE)
  • Starting the tutorial (LEARN.EXE)
 
■ This error occurs more often when you are performing mixed-
  language-programming operations.
 
■ Possible solution:
 
  • Restart the programming environment without loading the
    quick library, then reload current project and perform
    the Make .EXE operation.
 
■ If you need additional help, move the cursor to a keyword
  and press F1 to open the Help window.

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<div class="page-title"> Insufficient XMS, EMS, or disk space to save state</div>
<pre>■ There is not enough extended memory (XMS), expanded
  memory (EMS), or free disk space to perform one of the
  following operations:
  • Make an executable file (Make .EXE dialog)
  • Start the Form Designer (FD.EXE)
  • Start the tutorial (LEARN.EXE)
 
■ You must have between 300k-500k memory/disk space
  available in order to perform this type of operation.
 
■ Possible solutions:
 
  • Reboot your machine or restart Visual Basic to free
    up memory.
 
  • Delete some files from your hard drive to free up
    disk space.
 
■ If you need additional help, move the cursor to a keyword
  and press F1 to open the Help window.

<pre>■ There is not enough extended memory (XMS), expanded
  memory (EMS), or free disk space to perform one of the
  following operations:
  • Make an executable file (Make .EXE dialog)
  • Start the Form Designer (FD.EXE)
  • Start the tutorial (LEARN.EXE)
 
■ You must have between 300k-500k memory/disk space
  available in order to perform this type of operation.
 
■ Possible solutions:
 
  • Reboot your machine or restart Visual Basic to free
    up memory.
 
  • Delete some files from your hard drive to free up
    disk space.
 
■ If you need additional help, move the cursor to a keyword
  and press F1 to open the Help window.

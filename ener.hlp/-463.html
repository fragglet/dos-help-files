<pre>■ Visual Basic will not make a Quick library with the same
  name as a Quick library already loaded into memory.
 
■ Possible solutions:
 
  • Type a different name in the text box for the new Quick
    library to include the contents of the loaded library in
    the new one you are building.
 
  • Invoke Visual Basic from the command line without using
    the /L option to make a Quick library that doe not include
    a previously made one.
 
■ If you need additional help, move the cursor to a keyword
  and press F1 to open the Help window.

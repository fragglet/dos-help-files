    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<div class="page-title"> Array already has control at index</div>
<pre>■ You tried to change the name of a control that is part of
  a control array to the same name as another control, and
  the two controls have the same index value.
 
■ Possible solutions:
 
  • Change the name of the control so that it does not
    conflict with the existing control array.
 
  • Change the index value of the control so that it does
    not conflict with the index values in the existing
    control array.
 
■ If you need additional help, move the cursor to a keyword
  and press F1 to open the Help window.

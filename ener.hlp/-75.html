<pre>■ More than one condition can cause this error:
 
  • During an OPEN, MKDIR, CHDIR, or RMDIR operation, the
    operating system was unable to make a correct connection
    between the path and file name.
 
  • You tried to save a file that replaces an existing read-
    only file. If your project (.MAK) file is read-only, the
    entire program cannot be saved.
 
■ Possible solutions:
 
  • In the programming environment, make sure the file name
    you entered in the text box is formatted correctly. Any
    file name can contain a full or partial path:
    ♦ A full path starts with the drive name.
    ♦ A partial path has one or more directory names before
      the file name, but does not include a drive name.
 
  • From MS-DOS, use the ATTRIB command to change the read-
    only status of the specified file.

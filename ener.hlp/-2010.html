<pre>■ More than one condition can cause this error:
 
  • The name of a procedure is the same name as another
    procedure or variable.
 
  • You attempted to create a new element in your program
    and give it a name that is already being used (for
    example, a CONST statement with the same name as an
    existing variable, or a new variable or procedure with
    the same name as an existing procedure).
 
  • You attempted to create a file with the name of a file
    that is already loaded.
 
  • You attempted to load a file containing a non-form event
    procedure with the same name as an existing procedure.
 
  • You attempted to name a variable with the first two
    letters "FN."
 
  • You attempted to add a $FORM metacommand with a form
    name used in a previous $FORM metacommand.
 
■ Possible solutions:
 
  • Rename the procedure or variable.
 
  • Use a different constant, variable, procedure, form, or
    file name.
 
  • Cancel the command and rename or unload the conflicting
    file.

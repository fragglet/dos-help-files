    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>■ While debugging, you have made a change that prevents
  execution from continuing.
 
■ "Cannot continue" is a prompt that may occur while you
  are debugging. While your program was suspended (at a
  breakpoint, for example) you made a change to the program
  that has implications throughout the program. You may have
  redimensioned an array, changed procedure arguments, or
  edited some other declarative statement.
 
■ Possible solutions:
 
  • Choose:
    ╔════════╗
    ║   OK   ║ To keep the change and restart the program.
    ╚════════╝
    ┌────────┐
    │ Cancel │ To undo the change in your program text.
    └────────┘ (Do this if restarting interferes with your
               debugging strategy.)
 
■ If you need additional help, move the cursor to a keyword
  and press F1 to open the Help window.

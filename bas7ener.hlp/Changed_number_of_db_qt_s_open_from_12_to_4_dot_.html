   â–  ISAM has a limit to the number of databases and tables
     that can be open at one time and your program has
     exceeded this limit. ISAM can open up to 4 databases
     and 4 to 13 tables (depending on the number of
     databases open). Change your program so it closes
     tables or databases that exceed this limit.

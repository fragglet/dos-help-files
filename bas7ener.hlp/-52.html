    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<div class="page-title"> Bad file name or number</div>
<pre>This error may occur because of one of these situations:
  ■ A statement or command refers to a file with a file
    number or name that is not specified in the OPEN
    statement or is out of the range of file numbers
    specified earlier in the program.
  ■ No ISAM table (or any other file) is currently open with
    the file number used in an ISAM statement or function.
  ■ A file exists with the filename used in an OPEN FOR ISAM
    statement, but it was not created by ISAM.
  ■ You have used an invalid filename in an OPEN FOR ISAM
    statement. A filename must conform to the DOS
    naming convention.
 
ERR code: 52

<pre>This error may occur because of one of these situations:
  ■ A statement or command refers to a file with a file
    number or name that is not specified in the OPEN
    statement or is out of the range of file numbers
    specified earlier in the program.
  ■ No ISAM table (or any other file) is currently open with
    the file number used in an ISAM statement or function.
  ■ A file exists with the filename used in an OPEN FOR ISAM
    statement, but it was not created by ISAM.
  ■ You have used an invalid filename in an OPEN FOR ISAM
    statement. A filename must conform to the DOS
    naming convention.

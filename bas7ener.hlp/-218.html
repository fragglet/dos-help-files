<pre>During debugging, you used the Set Next Statement command to
specify a statement that is in a procedure other than
the one where program execution is suspended. QBX ignores
the Set Next Statement command.
 
Move the suspended procedure into the View window and, if
you still want to use a Set Next Statement command, use it
to start running from a statement in that procedure.

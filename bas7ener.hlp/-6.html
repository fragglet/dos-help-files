The result of a calculation or data type conversion
is too large to be represented within the range allowed
for that type of number.
 
If you are creating a new index on an ISAM table:
  ■ If there are already 28 indexes existing for the table,
    you will have to delete an index before you can create
    a new one.
  ■ The combined width of the column(s) you named for the
    index cannot exceed 255 bytes.
 
If you are opening an ISAM table:
  ■ There cannot be more than 60 "long" columns already open
    (long columns are arrays, user-defined types, or strings
    with more than 255 bytes).

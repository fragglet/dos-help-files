    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<div class="page-title"> Calls menu commands</div>
<pre>The Calls menu shows the last eight procedure calls executed
prior to an untrapped error, a breakpoint or watchpoint, or
you pressing Ctrl+Break.
 
The called procedures are arranged in the order of
execution, with the most recent on top. To view the program
text for any listed procedures, choose the procedure name
from the menu.
 
Tip: You can use the list of procedures in the Calls
     menu to control further program execution, gradually
     "backing out" of the execution stack:
 
     1. Choose a procedure name from Calls.
     2. When the program text is displayed, the cursor will
        be on the line following the call that led to the
        point where execution halted.
     3. Press F7 to restart execution from that point to the
        cursor location.
     4. Use the Watch window to look at variable values
        returned from procedures lower in the stack.

<div class="page-title"> Module not found. Unload module from program?</div>
<pre>When QBX loaded a multiple-module program, it could not find
one of the modules listed in the .MAK file. To complete the
load process, QBX created an empty module to satisfy the
.MAK file's module list.
 
When you run the program, you can do one of the following:
  ■ Choose OK to delete the empty module and the .MAK file
    entry for the module.
  ■ Choose Cancel to cancel this run operation so you can
    either:
      - Reconcile the .MAK file entry with a module file
        you may have in another directory.
      - Save the program text you have just entered into
        the empty module so you can try running it again.

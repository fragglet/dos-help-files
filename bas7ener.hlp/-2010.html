    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>You are attempting to create a new element in your program
and have given it a name that is already being used.
 
For example:
  ■ A CONST statement uses the same name as an existing
    variable.
  ■ A new variable or procedure has the same name as an
    existing procedure.
 
This error also can be generated when you attempt to create
a file using the name of a file that is already loaded. Use
a different filename in the dialog box or cancel the
command and rename or unload the conflicting file.
 
Starting a variable name with the letters "FN" is another
way to generate this error.

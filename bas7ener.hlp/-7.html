    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>More memory was required than is available.
 
General:
  ■ Reduce the size of your DOS buffers.
  ■ Eliminate any terminate-and-stay-resident programs.
  ■ Eliminate some device drivers.
  ■ Make your programs smaller.
  ■ In the QBX environment, unload any document, source
    files, or include files that are in memory but not
    needed.
 
Expanded memory:
  ■ If you are using QBX and expanded memory, make sure
    that expanded memory is available:
      1.  Execute PRINT FRE(-3) in the Immediate window.
          The value returned shows how much expanded
          memory is available.
      2.  If PRINT FRE(-3) causes the error message,
          "Feature unavailable," check to see if you are
          using LIM-4.0-compatible EMM memory and driver.
  ■ Make sure you are making the best use of expanded
    memory. For more information, see "Memory Management
    for QBX" in Getting Started.
 
Extended memory:
  ■ If you are using QBX and extended memory, make sure
    that extended memory is available:
      1.  Load QBX without the extended memory driver
          (HIMEM.SYS or other extended memory driver).
      2.  Execute PRINT FRE(-1) in the Immediate window.
          Note the value returned.
      3.  Install the extended memory driver and then
          load QBX.
      4.  Execute PRINT FRE(-1) in the Immediate window.
          If extended memory is available, the value
          returned should be about 60K greater than the
          value returned without extended memory.
 
DGROUP memory:
  ■ You may be out of space in DGROUP even if you have
    space left in far memory, expanded memory, and/or
    extended memory. Execute PRINT FRE(-1) in the Immediate
    window. If the value returned is greater than 1K, you
    can free up some space in DGROUP by:
      -  Reducing the number of dynamic string arrays
      -  Reducing the stack size
      -  Putting your routines into a Quick library
 
ISAM memory issues:
  ■ If you are using ISAM, see "Database Programming with
    ISAM" in the BASIC Programmer's Guide.
 
ERR code: 7

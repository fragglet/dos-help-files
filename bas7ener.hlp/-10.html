<pre>This error occurs if you try to change the dimensions of
a static array while your program is running. If you plan
to change the dimensions of an array while your program is
running, make sure it is a dynamic array and use the REDIM
statement to make the change.
 
This error also occurs if you declare the dimensions of
a dynamic array that has already been dimensioned using
either the DIM or REDIM statements without first using
ERASE to deallocate the array.
 
For ISAM, trying to create an index that already exists
will cause this error.
 
ERR code: 10

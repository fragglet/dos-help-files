<div class="page-title"> Path/file access error</div>
<pre>During an OPEN, MKDIR, CHDIR, or RMDIR operation, the
operating system was unable to make a correct connection
between the path and filename.
 
In the QBX environment, make sure the file specification
you entered in the text box is formatted correctly. Any
filename can contain a full or partial path. A full
path starts with the drive name; a partial path has
one or more directory names before the filename, but
does not include a drive name.
 
This error can also occur when you try to save a file which
would replace an existing read-only file.
 
ERR code: 75

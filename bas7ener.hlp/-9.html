<pre>An array element was referred to with a subscript that was
outside the dimensions of the array, or an element of an
undimensioned dynamic array was accessed.
 
You may also get this error if the array size exceeds 64K,
the array is not dynamic, and the /AH option was not used.
 
Reduce the size of the array, make the array dynamic and
use the /AH command-line option.
 
When you use the huge /AH switch, you can declare dynamic
fixed-length strings and numeric arrays to a size greater
than 64K. However, if you are declaring a fixed-length
array and the size of its elements isn't an even power
of 2, a "gap" will appear in the segment blocks. At the
second occurrence of a gap, this expected error occurs.
 
You can compensate for this by padding the type to become
a size that is a power of 2.
 
ERR code: 9

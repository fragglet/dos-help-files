    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>Turn this toggle on when you want the QBX environment to:
  ■ Run your program at full speed
  ■ Record the last 20 lines of program code executed
    before a program stops
 
You can then step backward and forward through the 20 lines
of code recorded by History On by pressing Shift+F8 or
Shift+F10 to review branching and other program actions.
 
Tip: Use History On together with breakpoints to review any
     group of 20 consecutive statements in your program.

<pre>
During remote communications, the receive buffer
overflowed.
 
The size of the receive buffer is set by the /C
command-line option or the RB option in the OPEN COM
statement. To avoid this error, you can:
  ■ Check the buffer more frequently (with the LOC
    function)
  ■ Empty the buffer more often (with the INPUT$
    function).
 
ERR code: 69

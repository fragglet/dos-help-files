<pre>While debugging, you have made a change that prevents
execution from continuing.
 
In the QBX environment, Cannot continue is a prompt that
may occur while you are debugging. While your program was
suspended (at a breakpoint, for example) you made a change
to the program that has implications throughout the
program, not just the point where you made that change.
You may have redimensioned an array, changed procedure
arguments, or edited some other declarative statement. Use
the dialog box and either:
  ■ Choose OK to keep the change and restart the program.
  ■ Choose Cancel to undo the change in your program text.
    (You can do this if restarting interferes with your
    debugging strategy.)

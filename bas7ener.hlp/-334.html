<pre>Leaves the QBX environment temporarily so you can use DOS
commands.
To do this:
  1. Choose the DOS Shell command from the File menu.
  2. Perform DOS tasks, but don't delete any files that
     the QBX environment might need (loaded files,
     libraries).
  3. Type "exit" at the DOS prompt to return to the QBX
     environment.

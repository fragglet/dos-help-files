    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>One or more include files are loaded into memory that
have not been saved to disk since they were modified.
QBX needs to know which version of the include files
you want to run. Either:
  ■ Choose &lt;Yes&gt; to save the modified include files and
    run.
  ■ Choose &lt;No&gt; to run the program with the versions that
    are currently on disk (the unmodified versions).
  ■ Choose &lt;Cancel&gt; if you don't want to run the program.

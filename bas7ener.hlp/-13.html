    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<div class="page-title"> Type mismatch</div>
<pre>The variable is not of the required type. For example, you
are trying to use the SWAP statement with a string variable
and a numeric variable, or with two numeric variables of
different types. This error also can occur when using ISAM
in these conditions:
  ■ During an OPEN FOR ISAM operation, the data type of a
    record element does not match the data type of a table
    column.
  ■ During an ISAM INSERT operation, the number of elements
    in the record does not match the number of columns in
    the table, or the data type of a record element does not
    match the data type of a table column.
  ■ During an ISAM RETRIEVE operation, the data type of a
    record element does not match the data type of a table
    column.
  ■ In an ISAM SEEKoperand statement, there is a data-type
    mismatch between the key-value argument and the current
    index.
  ■ During an ISAM UPDATE operation, the record variable is
    not the same user-defined type as the table you are
    attempting to update.
 
ERR code: 13

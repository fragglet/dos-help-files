<pre>QBX is about to save a file and finds one or more include
files that have been loaded into memory but not saved to
disk since they were modified. Either:
  ■ Choose &lt;Yes&gt; to save the modified include files and
    then save the program file.
  ■ Choose &lt;No&gt; to save the program file, but not the
    modified include files, if you are still experimenting
    with the include file or do not have complete
    confidence in it.
  ■ Choose &lt;Cancel&gt; or press ESC if you don't want to save
    any files.

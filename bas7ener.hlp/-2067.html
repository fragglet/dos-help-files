    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<div class="page-title"> QBX too many files limit</div>
<pre>QBX has a limit to the number of disk files it can
have open at any one time, and your program is at that
limit. Before this command can be executed, you need to
close some of these files.
 
The easiest way to do this is with the BASIC CLOSE
statement:
   1. Move the cursor to the Immediate window.
   2. Enter CLOSE on the first available text line.
   3. Press ENTER to execute the statement.
 
You can then execute the QBX command you were
attempting before. If your program was running, you
will have to restart it.

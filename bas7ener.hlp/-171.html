<pre>
An ELSE clause appears without a corresponding IF.
Sometimes this error is caused by incorrectly nested IF
statements.
 
Also check other control structures within the IF...ENDIF
block and verify that they are correctly matched. For
example, a nested IF block without a matching ENDIF
inside the outer IF...ENDIF block generates this error.

You are attempting to run the program after you have
unloaded the main module. Every program must have a main
module so QBX knows where to start running the program.
Either:
   ■ Use the Load File command from the File menu to reload
     the main module you unloaded.
   ■ Use the Set Main Module command from the Run menu to
     make a currently loaded module the main module.

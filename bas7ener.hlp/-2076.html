<pre>QBX cannot find a path to the filename you specified in
the dialog box. QBX also may have looked along these
other paths, depending upon the filename extension:
   ■ Paths specified by the Options menu's Set Paths
     command.
   ■ Paths specified by DOS environment variables PATH,
     INCLUDE, or LIB.
 
Note: If the file name is eight or less characters with no
      period, QBX assumes the extension .BAS. If the file
      name is between 9 and 11 characters, QBX puts a
      period after the eighth character.
 
First, make sure you spelled the filename correctly in
the dialog box. If it is correct, adjust the path
specification in either the dialog box, the Set Paths
command, or the DOS environment variable.

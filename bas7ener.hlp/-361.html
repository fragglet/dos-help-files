<pre>Use to combine a set of program modules into a Quick
library file or to update an existing Quick library.
 
Make a Quick library when you have created a set of
procedures that you want to use in more than one program.
Quick libraries are convenient and save disk space.
 
You can load a Quick library by using the /L option in
the QBX command line when you invoke the QBX environment.

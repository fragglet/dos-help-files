<pre>Use to copy the contents of the file currently displayed
in the active view window to disk.
 
If the file has not been named, the Save command will ask
you for a name and format. If a disk file has the same
name as the file being saved, the disk file will be
overwritten.
 
 Tip:  The Save As command in the File menu always asks
       for a new filename.

You have used a number that is inappropriate for the
context in which it is used. For example, BASIC does not
allow you to declare a fixed-length string of zero length,
so DIM X AS STRING * 0 is illegal. An illegal number also
occurs if you declare contradictory values. For example,
using an integer type declaration character with a
floating-point number (for example, 10.20%) causes this
error.

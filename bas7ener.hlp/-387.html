This command toggles the QBX Extended Smart Editor
syntax checking function on and off.
 
As you enter each line, the Smart Editor:
  1. Checks the line for syntax errors
  2. Formats the line
  3. Translates the line to executable form if the syntax
     is correct
 
Turn off syntax checking to enter program code for debugging
later.
 
When syntax checking is on, a bullet character is displayed
to the left of the command.
 
The Smart Editor functions are turned off if you select the
Document option with Create File or Load File.

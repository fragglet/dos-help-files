<pre>Command is active only when the cursor is positioned on an
$INCLUDE line in a loaded program.
 
Use to load an include file into the View window so you can
change it:
  1. Place the cursor on the $INCLUDE metacommand that names
     the file you want to edit.
  2. Choose the Included File command.
  3. Edit the file in the View window, then choose Save As
     from the File menu, or debug your program with the
     include file incorporated and save the file later, as
     part of the program.
 
Tip: To view the program text while you edit the include
     file:
       1. Split the View window with the View menu's Split
          command.
       2. Choose Load File from the File menu to load the
          include file.
       3. Return the program to the program text to make its
          window active again. You can now run your program.

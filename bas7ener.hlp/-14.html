<pre>There are too many string variables for the amount of memory
available for strings. Strings compete with other types of
program data for memory. To get more space for strings,
try one or more of the following:
  ■ In the QBX environment, unload any document, source
    files, or include files that are not needed.
  ■ If you are running a compiled program, use the BC
    command-line option /Fs (far-strings) or choose the Far
    Strings compiler option from the QBX Run menu's Make EXE
    File dialog box.
  ■ If you are using far strings, the "Out of string space"
    message occurs when any one of the 64K far string
    segments is filled or BASIC cannot increase the segment
    size to 64K. These segments and their contents are:
 
    Far string
    segment         Contents
    ═════════════   ════════════════════════════════════════
    Module          Module-level string variables
    segment         Module-level string array elements
                    Procedure-level static string variables
                    Procedure-level static string array
                      elements
                    Named COMMON string variables
                    Named COMMON string array elements
 
    COMMON          Strings in unnamed COMMON
    segment         String array elements in unnamed COMMON
 
    Local string    Procedure-level local string variables
    segment         Temporary strings
 
    Local string    Procedure-level local string array
    array segment   elements
                    (Note: There is one local string array
                    segment per procedure. It is allocated
                    when the procedure is invoked and
                    released when the procedure is
                    exited.)
 
  ■ Find out which of the above string segments is filled
    by using FRE(string variable). This returns how much
    string space is left in the segment where the string
    variable is located.
  ■ If one segment is filled, you can free up space by
    moving a string from the filled segment into another
    segment. For example, if the module segment is filled,
    you can change a module-level string to a string in
    unnamed COMMON.

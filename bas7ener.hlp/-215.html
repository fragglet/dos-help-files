<pre>You are about to clear the contents of memory and one or
more files are loaded in memory that have not been saved
since the last time they were changed. Either:
  ■ Choose &lt;Yes&gt; to save the file or files and then
    execute the command. If one of the files is not named,
    you will be prompted for its filename.
  ■ Choose &lt;No&gt; to clear memory without saving the files,
    then execute the command.
  ■ Choose &lt;Cancel&gt; to stop the command, leaving the
    contents of memory the same as before you chose the
    command.

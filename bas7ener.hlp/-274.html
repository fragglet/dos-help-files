<pre>QBX will not make a Quick library with the same name as a
Quick library already loaded into memory. Either:
  ■ Enter a different name in the text box for the new
    Quick Library to include the contents of the loaded
    library in the new one you are building.
  ■ Re-invoke QBX from the command line without using the
    /L option. This lets you make a Quick library that
    does not include a previously made one.

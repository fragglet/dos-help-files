<body>
<pre>
The syntax of a metacommand is incorrect.
Metacommands must be preceded by a comment. For example,
both of the $INCLUDE metacommands below are correct:
 
REM  $INCLUDE:  'filespec'
'  $INCLUDE:  'filespec'
 
If you are compiling the program with BC, this error is not
"fatal." The program will execute, but the results may be
incorrect.

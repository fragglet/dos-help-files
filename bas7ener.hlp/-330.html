Use to begin entering a new file for a multiple-module
program. This can be:
    ■ A program module
    ■ An include file
    ■ A document file
 
The new file will become part of the currently loaded
program.
 
 Tip: Create File can be used when no program is loaded
      as an alternative to the File menu's New Program
      command to create a new main program module.

<pre>A COMMON statement or a DECLARE statement is misplaced.
COMMON and DECLARE statements must appear before any
executable statements. All BASIC statements are executable
except the following:
 
    COMMON                     OPTION BASE
    CONST                      REM
    DATA                       SHARED
    DECLARE                    STATIC
    DEFtype                    TYPE
    DIM (for static arrays)    All metacommands

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>Include file text is displayed in the View window along
with program text, but the include file text is read-only.
If you want to edit the include file, you must put it in
a separate View window.
  ■ Choose &lt;OK&gt; to move the include file text into a new
    View window so you can edit it.

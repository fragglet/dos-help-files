<pre>Before completing execution, the SUBs command needs
confirmation that you want to delete this procedure
from the current module. Either:
  ■ Choose &lt;OK&gt; to execute the command and delete the
    procedure.
  ■ Choose &lt;Cancel&gt; to stop the command, leaving everything
    as it was before you chose the command.

<pre>This error can occur when there are too many active
subroutine, FUNCTION, and SUB calls, or when a recursive
FUNCTION procedure nests too deeply.
 
You can change the structure of your program or use the
CLEAR or STACK statement to increase the program's allotted
stack space.
 
This error cannot be trapped.

    The pages on this site contain documentation for very old MS-DOS software,
    purely for historical purposes.

    If you're looking for up-to-date documentation, particularly for programming,
    you should not rely on the information found here, as it will be woefully
    out of date.

<pre>Use to copy the file currently displayed in the active view
window from memory to disk. The file remains in memory.
 
With Save As you can save to a different file than the one
you loaded your program from, preserving the original
version.
 
Tip: Save is faster than Save As, but Save always
     overwrites the disk file from which the current file
     was loaded. Use Save All when you are working on
     multiple-module programs.

Turn this toggle on when you want the QBX environment to:
  ■ Run your program in slow motion, highlighting each
    statement as it executes
  ■ Record the last 20 lines of program code executed
    before a program stops
 
This lets you observe the general flow of your program.
Use with watchpoints, breakpoints, or Ctrl+Break to
suspend program execution periodically.
 
Then use Shift+F8 and Shift+F10 to single-step backward
and forward through the last 20 lines of code.

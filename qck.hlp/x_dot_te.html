 Tracing Execution
 
 ■ With event-driven programming, it is not always obvious what the first
   statement executed will be. Because of this, tracing execution is useful
   in Visual Basic.
 
 ■ Use these techniques to trace the execution of code:
   • Single stepping traces through each line of the procedure.
     Use this when you want to see the effect that each statement produces.
   • Procedure stepping executes each procedure as if it were a single
     statement. Use this technique in place of single stepping when you want
     to step across procedure calls rather than into the called procedure.
 
 ■ Watches are commonly used with single stepping and procedure stepping.

 ■ To trace execution from the current statement:
   • Press F7 to execute code to the current cursor position
   • Press F8 to execute code one line at a time
   • Press F10 to step across procedure calls
   See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='x_dot_dk.html'>Run and Debug Keys</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>
 
 ■ You can also set a breakpoint within a procedure before you start running
   the application. When the application halts at the breakpoint, trace from
   there. See: <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='x_dot_setb.html'>Setting Breakpoints</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>

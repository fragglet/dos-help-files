                  The Resource Compiler CONTROL Statement
 
<b>CONTROL text, id, x, y, width, height, class[, style]</b>
[ data-definitions ]
[ BEGIN
<i>control-definition</i>
    .
    .
    .
END ]
 
The CONTROL statement defines a control as belonging to the specified class.
The statement defines the position and dimensions of the control within the
parent window, as well as the control style. The CONTROL statement is most
often used in a DIALOG or WINDOW statement.
 
Typically, several CONTROL statements are used in each DIALOG statement, and
each CONTROL statement must have a unique id value. The optional BEGIN and
<b>END state</b>ments enclose any CONTROL statements that may be given with the
control. CONTROL statements given in this manner represent child windows
belonging to the control created by the CONTROL statement.
 
<b>Field               Description</b>
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 
<i>text</i>                Specifies text that is displayed to the right of the
                    control. This field must contain zero or more characters
                    enclosed in double quotation marks. Character values
                    must be in the range 1 through 255. If a double
                    quotation mark is required in the text, you must include
                    the double quotation mark twice. In the appropriate
                    styles, a tilde (~) character in the text indicates that
                    the following character is used as a mnemonic character
                    for the control. When the control is displayed, the
                    tilde is not shown, but the mnemonic character is
                    underlined. The user can choose the control by pressing
                    the key corresponding to the underlined mnemonic
                    character.
 
<i>id</i>                  Specifies the control identifier. This value must be an
                    integer in the range 0 through 65,535, or a simple
                    expression that evaluates to a value in that range.
 
<i>x  </i>                 Specifies the x-coordinate of the lower-left corner of
                    the control. This value must be an integer in the range
                    0 through 65,535 or an expression consisting of integers
                    and the addition (+) or subtraction (-) operator. The
                    coordinate is assumed to be in dialog units and is
                    relative to the origin of the parent window.
 
<i>y  </i>                 Specifies the y-coordinate of the lower-left corner of
                    the control. This value must be an integer in the range
                    0 through 65,535 or an expression consisting of integers
                    and the addition (+) or subtraction (-) operator. The
                    coordinate is assumed to be in dialog units and is
                    relative to the origin of the parent window.
 
<i>width</i>               Specifies the width of the control. This value must be
                    an integer in the range 1 through 65,535 or an
                    expression consisting of integers and the addition (+)
                    or subtraction (-) operator. The value is in ¼-character
                    units.
 
<i>height</i>              Specifies the height of the control. This value must be
                    an integer in the range 1 through 65,535 or an
                    expression consisting of integers and the addition (+)
                    or subtraction (-) operator. The value is in
                    1/8-character units.
 
<i>class</i>               Specifies the control class. This value can be one of
                    the classes specified in the topic <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='../unknown.html#Control Classes'>Control Classes</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span> or
                    the name of the control class enclosed in double
                    quotation marks.
 
<i>style</i>               Specifies the control style. For a list of possible
                    classes, see the topic <span class='grhilite'>◄</span><a href='../unknown.html#Control Styles'>Control Styles</a><span class='grhilite'>►</span>. You can use the
                    bitwise OR (|) operator to combine styles.
 
<i>data-definitions    Specifies a CTLDATA and/or PRESPARAMS statement. These</i>
                    statements define control and presentation data for the
                    control. For more information, see the CTLDATA and
                    PRESPARAMS topics.
 
<i>control-definition  Specifies a CONTROL statement or a</i>ny one of several
                    predefined control statements. These statements define
                    the style, position, and dimensions of controls in the
                    control.
 
<b>Comments</b>
 
The CONTROL statement can actually contain any combination of CONTROL,
<b>DIALOG, and WINDOW statements.</b> Typically, a CONTROL statement contains no
such statements.
 
<b>Example</b>
 
This example creates a push-button control with the WS_TABSTOP and
WS_VISIBLE styles.
 
CONTROL "OK", 101, 10, 10, 20, 50, WC_BUTTON, BS_PUSHBUTTON |
                                              WS_TABSTOP    |
                                              WS_VISIBLE
